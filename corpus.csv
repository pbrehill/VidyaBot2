lotta live art discourse is bout wht the performing body already signifies.
"this sort of casting often comes from refusing 2 replicate harm in a representational way,"
"the body on stage already carries it,"
"the audience comes with it,"
it's theatre -
imagine it etc.
"not commenting on the rest of this as i haven't seen the work,"
but i feel increasingly there's interesting discourse disjuncture in how contemporary performance understands casting vs.
in lit-criticism...
So sorry Josh 
ugh such a classic reviewer response to anything that doesn't centre a minority trauma (like idk...maybe the intended audience for this work gets it and doesn't need it replicated in full to understand it as a force in the story)

Put me in pls
obsessed with this comment
This production ofAlibrandiachieves what most stage adaptations can only dream of;
it remains true to the heart of the original while teasing out fresh elements and mining the depth and breadth of the human experience -   
Ty!
Egg is baby baby is egg

i was right to be afraid for them.
in every millennial unless ur careful....the shadow self of ur boomer parents.
my friends who failed to keep themselves extremely online after uni are now all extremely cringe.
"one of them sent me an inspirational poem today and the other asked me if i've heard of ""crypto""."
it's like going home to a small town but they're literally next door.

"a nice read (for me,"
but here it is if u want)
post festival and covid.
and now back to my all consuming passion selling sunset:  
"pointedly absurd,"
committed to finding big laughter in strange places.
"Shes a worm,"
"shes a pyromaniac whale,"
"shes a crypto bro,"
"shes Vidya Rajan,"
all absurd choices.
Finally read this!
Have always wanted my very existence to be certified (correctly)
as absurd.
Ty Junkee!  
O no cordite
 
"sending my own tweets to my partner,,,ty sheryl sandberg "
this is how men used to be before they let them read the fountainhead :(
dion hercule poirot is queer culture
it's amazing to me that u don't realise ur showing ur whole ass.
it's funny how every british children's book writer from the 90s and naughties has just gone absolutely mad.
they were not ready for the internet.
should have kept them in their beatrix potter ass sheds at the bottom of the garden like giant unwired rabbits forever.
Haha ty
I just want everyone to kno tht during covid I invented a game show called Goblin vs.
King.
Does it make sense?
Wow.
Is there a rulebook?
Wtf.
Is there even a point system?
Uh these questions...it's like ur some kind of loser who's never played Goblin vs.
King...feel bad for u.
"me,"
during the gilded age:
more like gilded cage amirite ladies!!
yes i thought of that on my own women can do anything
ready to begin my recovery by absorbing every met gala take i guess
"i had covid last week and didn't tweet about it or anything even once,,,this is how finely tuned my body is to cringe induced by elon m*sk."
will literally shut down rather than read anything more bout the man.
everything is quite bad everywhere all at once
I loved this.
congrats!
it's perfect and i cried.
Im sorry x
fuck yeahhh @evelynaraluen

x
Omg maybe same??
Also an anti-vax protest started chanting outside and I couldn't hear anything properly for a full 10 seconds.
Melbourne so cursed tonight hahaha

it's wild to me i've had ny reach outside my friends lol.
"comedy has often made me feel like i'm the wrong demo/shape for it,"
so it's nice 2 have strangers not think so.
Also a nice one from that I won't screenshot cause spoilers actually.
But this tagline is my new email sign-off   
"This is a really nice review,"
ty for engaging with the work  
Eek

i mean it's only about 90 seconds of the whole but apparently it's worth it
shout out to the gen z bb in the front row who laughed at all my jokes then promptly turned to discuss them loudly with her friend like they were watching netflix at home.
it made the show super difficult but i kind of just wanted to give their damaged pandemic brains a hug.
Ooof
pure jealousy

feels completely mad to have been living like a cloistered nun trying not to get it but could very possibly just get it tonight at my first show lol.
i'm amazed so many runs haven't fallen apart tbh.
aaah ty!

If you want to see Respawn at Comedy Festival a few accessible options might suit: 1) 21st April show will be in person and live streamed 2)  20th April will be Auslan interpreted 3)

"if ur a grant body,"
"casting agent,"

that it was too hard to send a rejection email.

A little preview of my video for tonight's launch.
Don't worry it's not just this for an hour (there are also a bunch of other great artists to raise the tone!)

also couples from manjimup shud get money to invigorate their music scenes just as a sound artist in the inner north might -
"but  if they need more production/planning support to do so maybe,"
there should be schemes that help that along!
not ones that function by whim.
"the amount of money isn't the issue,"
its the transparency of decision making and criteria especially in contrast with other usual processes and in a keeling industry (which of course we can talk about as inadequate and restrictive in criteria too)
that's a different issue though.
"and yes,"
sucks.
this scheme is not widening access in any meaningful way if you look at it.

"oh i agree,"
hence the perhaps -
"i wanted to direct it o most ppl likely reading this in my feed/art circles have probably benefited from and sustained the system by having abundance in some form at some time,"
myself included.
"that's a great point.  it does feel we have internalised failure or a lack of sellable outcomes as negative,"
"or ""waste""."
also which artists thrive when everyone else feels stretched?
"the most secure,"
someone with abundance.
"at times,"
we've all perhaps been that person -
but few can sustain it.
but many of us feel wrong if we can't-
how can u kill this thought when the institution rewards it?
i fully understand they are trying to communicate with a hostile funding environment/a sceptical audience. &amp;
yes  art is usually good for you.
"but artists are not emergency workers, &amp;"
"it is bit gross when salaried,"
secure ppl sculpt them into that to keep their positions alive.
"i get that it's a response to an environment where art events have to justify their investment or existence,"
and like 'good for u'
"is an easy sell,"
but yeah.
not into the marketing vibe from festivals/orgs re:
artists are always resilient/
will create work no matter what/&amp;
that the arts can heal people right now.
we aren't doctors -
in pay or training.
weaponising the language of duty is really short-sighted.

ty to my neighbours for spending this lockdown friday playing 5 hours of drum and bass.
this is the most alive i have felt in a week.
i am filled with hope and feel ready to take on the 90s.
london will know our names forever.
when I was writing for I had to spend a day researching this story.
I have stared at this bird a lot.
I can tell you no other bird deserves to encapsulate this year as much.
Look at him!!!  
Please help me make my dreams come true and join this cause
I nominate Adelaide Circus Theft Big Bird as #birdoftheyear
Truly it must be bird of the year
Nah I am genuinely inspired haha
feel certain all of this began when i overheard those guys decide they were gonna start a gourmet burger review podcast.
i will not explain what 'this'
is.
but i also won't deny it could be the global coronavirus pandemic.
didn't believe we could have it all till i saw people who are parents on here somehow still tweeting upto like 20 times a day ...
just breaking that shitposting ceiling ...
you are my inspiration
welcome fellow perths
"hmm vaxzevria does sound hot tho,"
"like she's comic book purple and really tall with conical tits and green wavy hair,"
anyway i'm having a normal time how are you
ahahaha
this the only one I have where im either dressed up &amp;
it's safe for work so uhhhhhh hope u have a thing for elves  
keith urban disquiets me but i think it may be because he's the only normal one there??
is this curfew a scam of Big Voice i mean i am somehow watching The Voice and now i think i will watch The Voice tomorrow too
Sorry ur going thru this xx
all reactions are valid to this incursion on the zaatar of the gods
maybe it would be worse if they knew but
I relate to her haha
Rome has fallen.
its so ridic.
i'd bet that most normal exhausted people (who aren't invested in cosplaying ww1)
are motivated by joy &amp;
hope &amp;
community ...
not the language of yet another battle
I have made some very cool Venn diagrams don't leave me hangin:
"my lockdown little grey cells (some would say ""ze mental health"")"
plan is going well:  
"thanking all these celebrities coming out as non-showerers,"
the imagine video catharsis of 2021
experts:
we need to increase trust in government communications  the govt:
aye betwixt the falling of the sun &amp;
the night all must take cover!
but how and whence???
dive beneath the platforms old and new to reveal the correct answer!!
teeheehee 
the only thing that has filled the selling sunset hole/scream in my heart
"on saturday,"
"my partner gets up,"
"jogs,"
and writes literary fiction at a small desk.
"i lie in bed with my electric blanket on high,"
"constantly redrafting the phrase ""hot girl hypermobility summer"""
till i need to pee.
that dweeb is lucky to have me.
pls the time is now
petition to make the government release the technology that will let us unhinge our entire jaws so we can eat a giant round cake in one big gulp like a cartoon
love to inspire the youth with my (f)art
"okay sinead's right,"
"we're all being too nice to each other,"
i blame james colley
"S,"
you are like the nicest person we know (non-malala category)
I can express genuine sentiment despite what the rumours/I myself constantly tell u!!
no amount of therapy has fixed my self-esteem as much as once saying to me: 'i only fuck with ppl who are on my level'
re:
us working together.
"i guess wildly respecting ur writing partner is good for something after all,"
apart from the art itself or whatever.
health hazard ass colleague 
"language evolves,"
sometime for the worse like how im starting to refer to bitches i don't like as comorbidities
"can't stand saruman,  ee's a total focken wanker reely"
same!
"let's acknowledge we're all experiencing this wholly encompassing global event that forces us to grapple with a changed reality and that it must have a name because all fonts do,"
so what is it
feel like covids turned us all into little fractal balls of surveillance
It is yuckk
I love her
Wtf is this
this is loving kindness meditation
one nice boiled potato
anyone else experiencing a real thinness in their inner desires lately?
"for example,"
i've spent the morning with the repetitive thought of:
i want one boiled potato.
never stop tweeting
Me rn  
everything was online and nothing hurt
also just false for eg:
india and china's emissions are much lower per capita than australia so just more bald faced lies I guess!

how ppl treat their time is such an indicator.
the use of 'it was so urgent we couldn't factor you in'
for example -
so endemic in toxic orgs
*somewhere an ABS bureaucrat puts down his abacus and frowns*  
Is v funny and weird
nah
"These are great free nights streamed on fb,"

Luxe Listings:

&gt;.&gt;
excuse me perfect topic is perfect
why this still relevant time is meaningless
"Hyper,"
often see things/thoughts and need to take a minute to put language to it.
"the UK really did all that spice colonialism and still can say things like ""add salt and pepper to taste"""
at least use the loot i'm so embarassed for u
unfortunately  has been listed as a tier 1 exposure site
Yes I want this/to do it so bad
but u have to finish the course too now 
"my boyfriend and I saw you across our 5km radius,"
do u wanna go for a walk
we literally been on that old beach for a year and a half now don't need to watch a movie bout it???
so what's everyone in lockdown gonna do for a head sponge now that the Olympics is over
u know my address!!
"watching crime dramas with my partner and they ask a procedural question that I immediately answer with scary intensity,"
secretly frothing that I maybe haven't wasted 7 years of legal training ...I guess we all become MCU boyfriend in one way or the other
I don't really get the desire to have a wedding at all but if u invite me to yours I will weep huge joyous tears literally through the entire ceremony.
Being alive is complex!!

laughs in australian TV *
Can't wait to read!
Have a cathart !!
dwelling on all my failures to ratchet up anxiety before this breathwork meditation workshop begins so i really get my money's worth
okay!

"like icarus we stuck those donuts in our puss too early,"
and now the jam is leaking out 
"im sorry,"
that's so tough.
gotta keep those dreams alive!!!!
maybe this is the lockdown i'll finally fix my artist website
we should never have taught men the word banter
I wanna rub garam masala in their vents so bad
 
"off to the airport, 2 books in my bag for the 5 hour flight."
will I panic and buy a 3rd at the terminal bookshop?
only to then spend the whole flight either staring out the window or trying to guess what's wrong with the marriage of the couple next to me??
ya bet.
So cool
i want this
my friend:
do u think ur projecting?  me:  
happy day!
hope u had fun :)
"this is a time for unity,"
it is important for all of us to come together and agree we hate our friend's new boyfriend
sorry for ur loss
a tree of colour im so sorry
 
right??
honestly give some artists and comedians money to make some public health ads cheap.
sci comms is failing.
"don't care if it sounds arrogant,"
i really think we'd do a great job??
ok she may be a multi-millionaire who doesn't need the money but can we not tear down a woman of colour for standing up for her principles against a corporation like disney
nupp
nah no chance
just told my mother to leave my room so i could lie in bed with my electric blanket and listen to mitski ...
is this hot girl winter
"Social media has done much to diffuse and amplify post-truth discourses,"
but its greater significance is as an attractor for those thirsty for a vision of reality in which they get to play the hero.   
wow

"if you're in Perth,"
you should come stare at some amazing actors in pikachu masks at the blue room theatre in 'small &amp;

the only way these covid press conferences could get more glum is if they tacked on an open mic comedy slot before the headliner
how I feel watching women's gymnastics every 4 years must be what dudes who wanna talk about the national at 3 am must feel like {we are both aglow with a most sacred &amp;
perfect flame}
i have been informed this is a national ad and now i will lie down thank you
anyone else in WA just watch an ad where grinning olympians thanked gina rinehart for inspiring them or has the sand finally gone to my head
"Scott and I have a term for games like these - ""it's prairie"""
i.e.
the kind of thing you'd play on the long ceaseless days on the prairie.

"it was good,"

absolutely blew my chance to rebrand as a niche internet pandemic celeb /
d-grade sexy clown known only as Covidya Rajan
Unfortunately hearing the govt lobbied to get the barrier reef off the UN's danger list broke my brain &amp;
I had to talk to someone bout it  
"like doing insanity reps for years,"
and now I can lift 3 platforms a day
dont wanna brag but i can have bad mental health even without a lockdown??
i guess i can't stop overachieving idk 
"Not to quote our own sketch words,"
but hey ~~

most decisions passed off as logistical blunders by leaders are decisions to devalue certain ppl.
"if u actively care about something,"

"if you're not rich,"
"you're often working a lot more,"
and need more time.
all of these intersect with culture &amp;
race too.
you can't hold up hustle culture and say you champion diversity.
amazing but how is a 10 day application period access-friendly?

my breath is already shallow
also i am not talking bout covid but a deeper illness
the thought of making small talk in a melbourne theatre foyer again.....have we learnt nothing.
buying a cheese that's not a slice
these tweets are like a sad lyrics version of colours of the wind
omg I think about this app an unhealthy amount
have you been up till the hour if the garbage truck ....
a unique horror
oh it's so much worse.
i went to national science camp and nearly quit my first degree to do medicine.
"it was a real long troll,"
poor things.
just remembered a cute thing!
i used to compulsively add v.
"large numbers together as a kid, &amp;"
"my father,"
"a real math guy,"
got very excited about what this could mean for my future.
it meant zero (that's a math term for you) &amp;
i grew up to struggle at the iga checkout on the reg.
"in what is extremely on brand,"
and I don't really play animal crossing but will nonetheless be appearing in game to walk around a gallery and critique art

i think a witch put a curse on my nose at some point.
Doctor:
it's just Sinusitis.  Me:
it is so nice it's just us!
hahaha.  Doctor: ...
what  Me:  i'm so sorry.
i am an only child.
i'm not joking.  
i am sorry to hear this but i stand by analysis of relationships.
this is normal.
in every relationship one partner is the kakapo parrot (the beloved)
and one is the voter organising the fraud (the belover)   
most of us are trying to get to NZ anyway.  
haha right??
it's such a con developing all this nuance.
i think the most surprising thing about being an adult is how cartoonishly evil the villains of the world actually are?
"like it literally do be a bunch of mitch mcconnells,"
"some  oil company turning seals orange,"
and a loser brainiac kid coding the end of society.
I'm not sorry.  
you should do stand-up

"well we had a 100 day semi-lockdown,"
but yeah it's been...very easy to let guard down.

it's worth it to inspire other diverses to believe that they too can someday appear on diversity panels.

"much prefer setting up a uh,"
"field of experience to help ppl vibe stuff,"

it can be a healthy thing i think to ponder.
by writing about the phenomenon  i've became totally more aware of my biases and context -
what i fear from the term was situated in what i wanted to gain from the world.
and i think that's the same across the political spectrum.

I kno a truly just world is foolish because when I don't reply to emails it's always because I am a delicate beautiful lamb but when others don't it's because they are  made from Devil taint.
No amount of awareness of this contradiction has changed my mind.
We're all doomed.
I wrote a very silly parody once where I played Elon Musk's defence lawyer on Mars.
He had merged with a Tesla to live on eternally and was trying to get out of a parking ticket.
Everyday this seems less unlikely.

Oh god does this mean the minute I step out I'm going to wake up and find myself hooked to the matrix.  
I was so surprised when I realised some of my friends parents were paying their HECS fees upfront to avoid debt later.
Like ten grand a year??
Sick of it coming down to this woman all the time but here we are.

I think bout this often lol.
So glad it's not just me.
I think like many terms when ur functioning in Anglo contexts ppl latch onto it as a kind of belonging/identifier before examining what it says bout their communities.
I think  its common when uve been trained to be reductive and there's movement away from it now.

Just realised Karl Stefanovic is not the same person as TV presenter Grant Denyer.

"Free-speech advocates,"
"of which I consider myself one,"
have often lauded the marketplace of ideas.
"Except the marketplace of ideas,"
only works if everyone is given equal space and time to hawk their wares.

last night i dreamt i was dating a cambridge student &amp;

This is perfect news. @indignant_ant
im sorry but if theatre kids don't mock music theatre kids once a year and vice versa we will all turn to stage dust.
i should not have watched hamilton twice in two days.
i literally can't hear what anyone is saying in conversation anymore.
the singing is inside me and very loud and constant.
is this what it's like to be a music theatre kid i'm so sorry.
 
srsly.
Maybe it's a writing critique.
The walkleys were too loud on the subtext.
We need nuanced tweets that allow readers to uncover the structures of a brand run industry on their own terms.
Stick together to do what?

please tell me to get fucked.
There's a real type on this website.
"Older self-identified ""lefties"""
with (for some reason always)

It's so bizarre.

Still so relevant today.  
 
....
lack of funding or monetary support is a part of what creates this unstructured space -
but it's also at some point ppl perpetuating it &amp;
not acceptable.
it's work &amp;
u shud feel safe at work.
"Thus it is like any industry,"
"but with even less accountability,"
"lax codes of conduct,"
few guidelines around complaint or resolution.the basics really.
"ppl think working in the arts is bout amazing creative energies coming together,"
but it's mostly witnessing ppl suck up to their friends with an ounce of power rather than take a stand over their unethical practices.

this was so on point.
thank you.
this is so startlingly rare i think i just teared up.
x
Fingers crossed!!
Most of the ppl speaking up now aren't doing so cause they're opportunistic internet bandits.
"It's cause we feel emboldened,"
a safety/relief in numbers.
If ur impulse is to see it as bandwagon that's part of the silence problem.
Ur fine 
I will report back 
Thank you for clarifying!
I honestly believe most apologies and think ppl want to be better.
But I am a pretty deranged and probs foolish optimist tht way.
I think ppl want to see evidence of understanding of harm plus some future actions.
I think the latter is the hardest bit.
My circle is discussing how to suck off an interdimensional being so we can get the fuck out of here.
Please advise if this is fitness or 1 night stand?
O god  .... 
I have avoided reading this to sleep this weekend aaaaa
to be clearer still -
my issue is with ppl who defend and de-centre the actual harm/
paint ppl as aggressors for complaining.
not saying white women can't be sad or remorseful -
just be aware that often it makes ppl minimise POC pain.
Think of it like a bad superpower.
yeah my problem is never with someone fucking up but in how POC are so easily painted as aggressors for bringing up issues.
And this is one sad sub facet of that -
u always hope marginality will lead to shared alliances right?
so it's worse when it doesn't.
not about Eliza -
actually haven't tuned into that lol.
"is a general and def historical trend,"
and I'm thinking of a few industry examples tbh.
anyone who knows me knows I'm not bout cancelling ppl -
I know ur learning and make mistakes -
i've just too often seen no real remorse or change as soon as these bird women seem sad.
Meanwhile POC aren't allowed to be sad or difficult.
Solidarity can be better than this please!!
I duno I read some public FB page comments lately and...yeh
once i drunk a full glass of water with my one beak.
it was the summer i was a crane.
those were the days!
"throw ur neck back,"
"quick sip,"
take flight.
the world's not wht it used to be.for one the sorceress who made me a summer-crane is dead.
nyway u don't see me goin on bout it.
not a single person in my family is able to recognise me as mildly funny.
the roles they give us are forever lol 
Ooooof
one day we will live in a world brave enough to tackle greek mythology.
Everyone's talking about these Sirens!

"me as an annoying millennial comic/just me right now,"

I've been hearing a lot about these men crashing their boats on the aegean after hearing a woman scream.
I'm not surprised...that tends to happen when u hear  a REAL ORGASM for the first time.  -
"me as a sassy woman comic,"
ancient greece.
"What's with all these men goin out to sea,"
crashin their boats after hearing Siren screams?
Hey if u want a screeching woman to drive u to ur death so bad u shud just spend time with my wife -

thanks friend :)
my life is one long hide and seek with (i'm convinced)
a single uniball pen
yeah this is just everyone we've been making fun of already right &gt;.&gt;
In my short law work life I saw the huge difference having lawyers from diverse backgrounds made to clients/victims.
And how blind so much legislation is to ppl on the margins.
These changes entrench the worst of the existing system.
This.
I barely became a lawyer cause of how toxic the corporate/white culture at law school was.
I worked mainly in the community sector &amp;
have a giant HECS bill I'm nowhere near paying off.
Lucky I'm an artist now 
oh for sure!
i meant recognition of it from 'establishment'
it's also just not true on numbers alone!
"plus,"
the work encouraged by diversity grants has mostly been about mandating art that responds whiteness/didactic trauma narratives etc.

ur stuck with me like a grimy little boil that never bursts or heals yum yum.  
talked briefly to about the underlying racism of our industry.
i talk about something i usually never do:
feeling like quitting.
but i think it's a normal response to these structures to have those thoughts and we shouldn't be ashamed of them 
very rude of some of u to be both racist &amp;
sexist.

Thanks for sharing this.

Hard disagreeeee 
love this @_budgie
what a great idea x
Yuppp 
Yeah for me it's the others laughing along and saying equally odd stuff.
It's a picture of a culture -
what parties and rooms all over must look like.
it's coming 
whiteness will use the 'capitalism'
excuse a lot -
"efficiency,"
"industry standards,"
the way it works etc.
my saddest moments are when BIPOC internalise these and replicate them.
never!
to sign on to that platform again?...i have a life to live
We're gonna change this shit x
"I was in a room with a really prominent white theatre director who sighed and said 'theyre just not on our level,"
maybe in a few years'
never stopping to think that maybe ur level is the same boring shit and should change.
A .
Open casting call in Tasmania broke me.
Like just do a white show about white ppl -
we'll be fine it.
Don't pretend U wanted to be diverse and couldn't find the talent.
yeah why is everyone laughing 
I feel great game writing is so attuned to audience emotion and agency.
Like immersive theatre.
It's what I love about it
I think we're all at diff learning stages at diff times.
Using it as an excuse would be shit -
there's no need to excuse it -
it is what it is.
Growth is more imp -
I care more bout the future changes powerful ppl are resolved to make.
Here if u need to chat xx
i'm sure everyone's had these thoughts -
it's just it's usually at ur friend's party and u can grow in private. -
"i'm trying to call in,"
not out.
being platformed at the opera house is what makes this seem really normal.
and it's not.
because i can't stop ruining my career by saying stuff -
i honestly had full body shiver &amp;
much sadness from this.
"white comedy ppl talking bout being allies,"
if u know the ppl on this panel reach out &amp;
talk to them hey? 2016 was ages ago so i hope they've got more nuance now.
"yeah and the whole 'we can't find diverse actors in tasmania' (when other white ppl in the show weren't cast from tas),"
"or the illogic of 'they're just not around,"
but when i do find them i make them 7/11 ppl'.
it's very...confusing.

enya
This is just to say I destroyed the statues tht were in the public square  Get fucked hey They were so racist And delicious to topple a few horrifying symbols of centuries of violence pass me a plum or some shit ??
gonna need that fructose lift to get rid of these bastards

just tried to imagine being on twitter in 2050
me:
how are all the kids on tik tok so energetic i don't think a single person i knew in high school was this alive  :
no they're just american  me:
o ya i forgot  

"i know,"
it's so hard to comprehend that all the genocidal racists aren't on the same side -
it's like history is complex or something gross like that.
it took a pandemic but my email etiquette has finally changed from the gendered nice tone &amp;
exclamation points to short sentences &amp;
full stops.
and no sign-offs -
where would i be going kunt?
we all live here all the time now.
ahh im not tht suspicious of fun.
if it's doing good and ur getting dopamine go for it.
joy can animate action as much as sadness.
also would advise changing from a statue not a good week for it 
"For instance,"
ppl i've seen enforcing this attitude are usually comfy white women on the left who are excited to prove themselves allies -
I feel like most ppl who are affected by stuff desperately want 'offenders'
to apologise and change so that shit gets better.
oh yeah cancel culture has loads of value.
"speaking out and even shame are useful/important to achieve change in many cases,"
esp for ppl who haven't been heard.
the sections of the left u and I are talking bout are both not those ppl.
sure  but thts clearly not what I'm talking about?
&amp;
obvs ppl who are hurt by someone's past actions have a right to be wary of them unless it's clear  there's been change -
marginalised ppl have enough going on without those gymnastics.
But ppl who pile on for cred like they've always been blameless/
superior is yuk.
Obvs this doesn't go for powerful ppl who've been given loads of community labour and education and refuse to listen (cough Rowling cough).

So I hope you all take a good look at yourselves.
same as it ever was -
"white gatekeepers,"
"a bad culture,"
no properly responsive incentives from broadcasters re:
"development/inclusion,"
few structured industry pathways for most people let alone anyone who doesn't want to spend 6 nights a week in scene that can be toxic to them.

you can't claim historical pride and exclude historical shame -
it's the same source.

Fair warning:
I have lost work cause of speaking up about this in the past/probably will again.
They love to think of us as difficult with the slightest   u gotta play that risk and that's ur choice no judgement 
Emerging BIPOC creators -
hot tip:
anytime someone says to you 'this is how the industry works'
or 'these are the rules'
"to justify ur pain,"
be wary.Treating systems as inviolable laws is the mark of someone who doesn't give a fuck about change.
Australia this is also you.
You're very happy to hire us to give cred to your brainstorms and authenticate 'diverse'

gonna become fully unbearable like every mediocre chud in power YES I WILL HAVE 5 MINISTRIES
honestly articles like this make me feel so gaslit bout shouting this stuff in media rooms &amp;
arts institutions for yrs &amp;
being dismissed.
"so wild that those who seemingly define the culture are actually yrs behind it.  (nyway um some of the language in this...""head wobbles""..ok)  "
hope ur doing ok &lt;3
lotta live art discourse is bout wht the performing body already signifies.
"this sort of casting often comes from refusing 2 replicate harm in a representational way,"
"the body on stage already carries it,"
"the audience comes with it,"
it's theatre -
imagine it etc.
"not commenting on the rest of this as i haven't seen the work,"
but i feel increasingly there's interesting discourse disjuncture in how contemporary performance understands casting vs.
in lit-criticism...
So sorry Josh 
ugh such a classic reviewer response to anything that doesn't centre a minority trauma (like idk...maybe the intended audience for this work gets it and doesn't need it replicated in full to understand it as a force in the story)
exactly this !

Totally missed this sketch I was in for a rational fear.
Very little acting needed on the distress front.
a sentence designed to depress me on every level  
scott don't jinx this!

perfect casting and also he can just wear literally any of his outfits from sex education &amp;

carissa!!! (my fav review)
gonna have to bail these bitches out when they fall for a text message scam in a year's time i just know it
this is what happens if u unplug urself so abruptly!
i was right to be afraid for them.
in every millennial unless ur careful....the shadow self of ur boomer parents.
my friends who failed to keep themselves extremely online after uni are now all extremely cringe.
"one of them sent me an inspirational poem today and the other asked me if i've heard of ""crypto""."
it's like going home to a small town but they're literally next door.
charlie ahaha
Yes!
True crime for ppl with adhd...sometimes it's like the algorithm is just conjuring permutations of ppl hey
Maybe for a one off show in a little bit!
i've been team Chrishell ever since I read tht her mum went into labor with her in a Shell service station while an attendant named Chris helped call an ambulance:
hence the name Chrishell.
This latest G-flip thing is just icing on the cake. #sellingsunsetreunion  
"a nice read (for me,"
but here it is if u want)
post festival and covid.
and now back to my all consuming passion selling sunset:  
"pointedly absurd,"
committed to finding big laughter in strange places.
"Shes a worm,"
"shes a pyromaniac whale,"
"shes a crypto bro,"
"shes Vidya Rajan,"
all absurd choices.
Finally read this!
Have always wanted my very existence to be certified (correctly)
as absurd.
Ty Junkee!  
O no cordite
 
"sending my own tweets to my partner,,,ty sheryl sandberg "
this is how men used to be before they let them read the fountainhead :(
dion hercule poirot is queer culture
it's amazing to me that u don't realise ur showing ur whole ass.
it's funny how every british children's book writer from the 90s and naughties has just gone absolutely mad.
they were not ready for the internet.
should have kept them in their beatrix potter ass sheds at the bottom of the garden like giant unwired rabbits forever.
Haha ty
I just want everyone to kno tht during covid I invented a game show called Goblin vs.
King.
Does it make sense?
Wow.
Is there a rulebook?
Wtf.
Is there even a point system?
Uh these questions...it's like ur some kind of loser who's never played Goblin vs.
King...feel bad for u.
"me,"
during the gilded age:
more like gilded cage amirite ladies!!
yes i thought of that on my own women can do anything
ready to begin my recovery by absorbing every met gala take i guess
"i had covid last week and didn't tweet about it or anything even once,,,this is how finely tuned my body is to cringe induced by elon m*sk."
will literally shut down rather than read anything more bout the man.
everything is quite bad everywhere all at once
I loved this.
congrats!
it's perfect and i cried.
Im sorry x
fuck yeahhh @evelynaraluen
yes pls
the only cure tht works
Feel this deep Aurelia x
It's true.
I did a French accent while imitating Hercule Poirot though everyone knows he's Belgian :(.
I apologise.
Je will do more bon.
Yay xx

I'm only on today and tomorrow at I'll probably never do a run of it in Melbourne again.
If u want to see what this person experienced :)
O wow ty.
That's really nice to hear.
I'm so glad u feel this way cause that is eaaaaaarly (even for a worm)
x
Omg maybe same??
Also an anti-vax protest started chanting outside and I couldn't hear anything properly for a full 10 seconds.
Melbourne so cursed tonight hahaha

Had the absolute weirdest quitest crowd in tonight.
At one point someone just said the word 'guantanomo'
to themselves.
"What roads have led me here,"
dear satan!!
jesus

Argh x
"tomorrow = thursday 21st ,,,wht is time"

Such an honour.
Ty Chris!
Ty for coming!!
ok i kno it's cringe but this still has me a bit  coz i don't personally kno laura or who these ppl cud be.
it's wild to me i've had ny reach outside my friends lol.
"comedy has often made me feel like i'm the wrong demo/shape for it,"
so it's nice 2 have strangers not think so.
Also a nice one from that I won't screenshot cause spoilers actually.
But this tagline is my new email sign-off   
"This is a really nice review,"
ty for engaging with the work  
Eek
this is a good state to be in to watch the show tbh
Omg Laura 
96 tram has 86 tram energy tonight.

All I've ever wanted with my art is to encourage ppl to work out their core   
we swapped!
Where is thisss
covid is making u amphibiousss
i mean it's only about 90 seconds of the whole but apparently it's worth it
shout out to the gen z bb in the front row who laughed at all my jokes then promptly turned to discuss them loudly with her friend like they were watching netflix at home.
it made the show super difficult but i kind of just wanted to give their damaged pandemic brains a hug.
Ooof
pure jealousy
"so much scientific research coming out about how the gut is a second brain when all they had to do was look at twitter,"

Ty!!
a great honour and of course u can stay masked the whole time
2020 energy off the charts!!!
literally why is no one talking about the constant covid anxiety at festival.
feels completely mad to have been living like a cloistered nun trying not to get it but could very possibly just get it tonight at my first show lol.
i'm amazed so many runs haven't fallen apart tbh.
aaah ty!
just read about someone winning   Australian GP &amp;

Hi
If you want to see Respawn at Comedy Festival a few accessible options might suit: 1) 21st April show will be in person and live streamed 2)  20th April will be Auslan interpreted 3)
For lift/wheelchair access i'm doing an extra show 19th April 9pm at Trades Hall in Carlton.

"hello yarra trams,"
i want to report i got on a tram and heard a guy say 'everything happens for a reason'
to his friend.
do not think this kind of behaviour should be encouraged in public space in 2022.

also couples from manjimup shud get money to invigorate their music scenes just as a sound artist in the inner north might -
"but  if they need more production/planning support to do so maybe,"
there should be schemes that help that along!
not ones that function by whim.
"the amount of money isn't the issue,"
its the transparency of decision making and criteria especially in contrast with other usual processes and in a keeling industry (which of course we can talk about as inadequate and restrictive in criteria too)
that's a different issue though.
"and yes,"
sucks.
this scheme is not widening access in any meaningful way if you look at it.

"oh i agree,"
hence the perhaps -
"i wanted to direct it o most ppl likely reading this in my feed/art circles have probably benefited from and sustained the system by having abundance in some form at some time,"
myself included.
"that's a great point.  it does feel we have internalised failure or a lack of sellable outcomes as negative,"
"or ""waste""."
also which artists thrive when everyone else feels stretched?
"the most secure,"
someone with abundance.
"at times,"
we've all perhaps been that person -
but few can sustain it.
but many of us feel wrong if we can't-
how can u kill this thought when the institution rewards it?
i fully understand they are trying to communicate with a hostile funding environment/a sceptical audience. &amp;
yes  art is usually good for you.
"but artists are not emergency workers, &amp;"
"it is bit gross when salaried,"
secure ppl sculpt them into that to keep their positions alive.
"i get that it's a response to an environment where art events have to justify their investment or existence,"
and like 'good for u'
"is an easy sell,"
but yeah.
not into the marketing vibe from festivals/orgs re:
artists are always resilient/
will create work no matter what/&amp;
that the arts can heal people right now.
we aren't doctors -
in pay or training.
weaponising the language of duty is really short-sighted.

'why are these women so melacholy'  'they are a melbourne band'  'okay'
oh no my partner played some sad woman indie song on vinyl and i am back in melbourne in 2021.
ty to my neighbours for spending this lockdown friday playing 5 hours of drum and bass.
this is the most alive i have felt in a week.
i am filled with hope and feel ready to take on the 90s.
london will know our names forever.
when I was writing for I had to spend a day researching this story.
I have stared at this bird a lot.
I can tell you no other bird deserves to encapsulate this year as much.
Look at him!!!  
Please help me make my dreams come true and join this cause
I nominate Adelaide Circus Theft Big Bird as #birdoftheyear
Truly it must be bird of the year
Nah I am genuinely inspired haha
feel certain all of this began when i overheard those guys decide they were gonna start a gourmet burger review podcast.
i will not explain what 'this'
is.
but i also won't deny it could be the global coronavirus pandemic.
didn't believe we could have it all till i saw people who are parents on here somehow still tweeting upto like 20 times a day ...
just breaking that shitposting ceiling ...
you are my inspiration
welcome fellow perths
"hmm vaxzevria does sound hot tho,"
"like she's comic book purple and really tall with conical tits and green wavy hair,"

it's safe for work so uhhhhhh hope u have a thing for elves  
keith urban disquiets me but i think it may be because he's the only normal one there??

Sorry ur going thru this xx
all reactions are valid to this incursion on the zaatar of the gods
maybe it would be worse if they knew but
I relate to her haha
Rome has fallen.
its so ridic.
i'd bet that most normal exhausted people (who aren't invested in cosplaying ww1)
are motivated by joy &amp;
hope &amp;
community ...
not the language of yet another battle
I have made some very cool Venn diagrams don't leave me hangin:
"my lockdown little grey cells (some would say ""ze mental health"")"
plan is going well:  
"thanking all these celebrities coming out as non-showerers,"
the imagine video catharsis of 2021
experts:
we need to increase trust in government communications  the govt:
aye betwixt the falling of the sun &amp;
the night all must take cover!
but how and whence???
dive beneath the platforms old and new to reveal the correct answer!!
teeheehee 
the only thing that has filled the selling sunset hole/scream in my heart
"on saturday,"
"my partner gets up,"
"jogs,"
and writes literary fiction at a small desk.
"i lie in bed with my electric blanket on high,"
"constantly redrafting the phrase ""hot girl hypermobility summer"""
till i need to pee.
that dweeb is lucky to have me.
pls the time is now
petition to make the government release the technology that will let us unhinge our entire jaws so we can eat a giant round cake in one big gulp like a cartoon

"we're all being too nice to each other,"
i blame james colley
"S,"
you are like the nicest person we know (non-malala category)
I can express genuine sentiment despite what the rumours/I myself constantly tell u!!
no amount of therapy has fixed my self-esteem as much as once saying to me: 'i only fuck with ppl who are on my level'
re:
us working together.
"i guess wildly respecting ur writing partner is good for something after all,"
apart from the art itself or whatever.
health hazard ass colleague 
"language evolves,"
sometime for the worse like how im starting to refer to bitches i don't like as comorbidities
"can't stand saruman,  ee's a total focken wanker reely"

"let's acknowledge we're all experiencing this wholly encompassing global event that forces us to grapple with a changed reality and that it must have a name because all fonts do,"

It is yuckk
I love her
Wtf is this

one nice boiled potato
anyone else experiencing a real thinness in their inner desires lately?
"for example,"
i've spent the morning with the repetitive thought of:
i want one boiled potato.
never stop tweeting
Me rn  
everything was online and nothing hurt
also just false for eg:
india and china's emissions are much lower per capita than australia so just more bald faced lies I guess!

how ppl treat their time is such an indicator.
the use of 'it was so urgent we couldn't factor you in'
for example -
so endemic in toxic orgs
*somewhere an ABS bureaucrat puts down his abacus and frowns*

"my boyfriend and I saw you across our 5km radius,"

we literally been on that old beach for a year and a half now don't need to watch a movie bout it???
so what's everyone in lockdown gonna do for a head sponge now that the Olympics is over
u know my address!!
"watching crime dramas with my partner and they ask a procedural question that I immediately answer with scary intensity,"
secretly frothing that I maybe haven't wasted 7 years of legal training ...I guess we all become MCU boyfriend in one way or the other
I don't really get the desire to have a wedding at all but if u invite me to yours I will weep huge joyous tears literally through the entire ceremony.
Being alive is complex!!

I wanna rub garam masala in their vents so bad
 
"off to the airport, 2 books in my bag for the 5 hour flight."
will I panic and buy a 3rd at the terminal bookshop?
only to then spend the whole flight either staring out the window or trying to guess what's wrong with the marriage of the couple next to me??
ya bet.
So cool
i want this
my friend:
do u think ur projecting?  me:

"this is a time for unity,"
it is important for all of us to come together and agree we hate our friend's new boyfriend
sorry for ur loss
a tree of colour im so sorry
 
right??
honestly give some artists and comedians money to make some public health ads cheap.
sci comms is failing.
"don't care if it sounds arrogant,"
i really think we'd do a great job??
ok she may be a multi-millionaire who doesn't need the money but can we not tear down a woman of colour for standing up for her principles against a corporation like disney
nupp
nah no chance
just told my mother to leave my room so i could lie in bed with my electric blanket and listen to mitski ...
is this hot girl winter
"Social media has done much to diffuse and amplify post-truth discourses,"
but its greater significance is as an attractor for those thirsty for a vision of reality in which they get to play the hero.

anyone else in WA just watch an ad where grinning olympians thanked gina rinehart for inspiring them or has the sand finally gone to my head

d-grade sexy clown known only as Covidya Rajan
Unfortunately hearing the govt lobbied to get the barrier reef off the UN's danger list broke my brain &amp;
I had to talk to someone bout it  
"like doing insanity reps for years,"

you can't hold up hustle culture and say you champion diversity.

why aren't you a 6-figure salaried banker whose greatest wish is to sleep in a windowless box???
omg going through the same thing.
it's next level.
"has this person never been to the theatre,"
it's been around a while.
my breath is already shallow
also i am not talking bout covid but a deeper illness
the thought of making small talk in a melbourne theatre foyer again.....have we learnt nothing.
buying a cheese that's not a slice
these tweets are like a sad lyrics version of colours of the wind
omg I think about this app an unhealthy amount
have you been up till the hour if the garbage truck ....
a unique horror
oh it's so much worse.
i went to national science camp and nearly quit my first degree to do medicine.

got very excited about what this could mean for my future.
it meant zero (that's a math term for you) &amp;

Doctor:
it's just Sinusitis.  Me:
it is so nice it's just us!
hahaha.  Doctor: ...
what  Me:  i'm so sorry.
i am an only child.
i'm not joking.  
i am sorry to hear this but i stand by analysis of relationships.
this is normal.
in every relationship one partner is the kakapo parrot (the beloved)
and one is the voter organising the fraud (the belover)   
most of us are trying to get to NZ anyway.  
haha right??
it's such a con developing all this nuance.
i think the most surprising thing about being an adult is how cartoonishly evil the villains of the world actually are?
"like it literally do be a bunch of mitch mcconnells,"
"some  oil company turning seals orange,"
and a loser brainiac kid coding the end of society.
I'm not sorry.  
you should do stand-up

"well we had a 100 day semi-lockdown,"

No amount of awareness of this contradiction has changed my mind.

I am in a lighthouse and I am fully losing my shit because I had recurring dreams about them nearly every night as a child but have never actually been in one?
Oh god does this mean the minute I step out I'm going to wake up and find myself hooked to the matrix.

"Free-speech advocates,"
"of which I consider myself one,"

This is perfect news. @indignant_ant
im sorry but if theatre kids don't mock music theatre kids once a year and vice versa we will all turn to stage dust.
i should not have watched hamilton twice in two days.
i literally can't hear what anyone is saying in conversation anymore.
the singing is inside me and very loud and constant.
is this what it's like to be a music theatre kid i'm so sorry.
 
srsly.
Maybe it's a writing critique.
The walkleys were too loud on the subtext.
We need nuanced tweets that allow readers to uncover the structures of a brand run industry on their own terms.

There's a real type on this website.
"Older self-identified ""lefties"""

....
lack of funding or monetary support is a part of what creates this unstructured space -
but it's also at some point ppl perpetuating it &amp;
not acceptable.
it's work &amp;

"Thus it is like any industry,"
"but with even less accountability,"
"lax codes of conduct,"
few guidelines around complaint or resolution.the basics really.
"ppl think working in the arts is bout amazing creative energies coming together,"
but it's mostly witnessing ppl suck up to their friends with an ounce of power rather than take a stand over their unethical practices.

this was so on point.
thank you.
this is so startlingly rare i think i just teared up.
x
Fingers crossed!!
Most of the ppl speaking up now aren't doing so cause they're opportunistic internet bandits.
"It's cause we feel emboldened,"
a safety/relief in numbers.
If ur impulse is to see it as bandwagon that's part of the silence problem.
Ur fine 
I will report back 
Thank you for clarifying!
I honestly believe most apologies and think ppl want to be better.
But I am a pretty deranged and probs foolish optimist tht way.
I think ppl want to see evidence of understanding of harm plus some future actions.
I think the latter is the hardest bit.
My circle is discussing how to suck off an interdimensional being so we can get the fuck out of here.
Please advise if this is fitness or 1 night stand?
O god  .... 
I have avoided reading this to sleep this weekend aaaaa
to be clearer still -
my issue is with ppl who defend and de-centre the actual harm/
paint ppl as aggressors for complaining.
not saying white women can't be sad or remorseful -
just be aware that often it makes ppl minimise POC pain.
Think of it like a bad superpower.
yeah my problem is never with someone fucking up but in how POC are so easily painted as aggressors for bringing up issues.
And this is one sad sub facet of that -
u always hope marginality will lead to shared alliances right?
so it's worse when it doesn't.
not about Eliza -
actually haven't tuned into that lol.
"is a general and def historical trend,"
and I'm thinking of a few industry examples tbh.
anyone who knows me knows I'm not bout cancelling ppl -
I know ur learning and make mistakes -
i've just too often seen no real remorse or change as soon as these bird women seem sad.
Meanwhile POC aren't allowed to be sad or difficult.
Solidarity can be better than this please!!
I duno I read some public FB page comments lately and...yeh
once i drunk a full glass of water with my one beak.
it was the summer i was a crane.
those were the days!
"throw ur neck back,"
"quick sip,"
take flight.
the world's not wht it used to be.for one the sorceress who made me a summer-crane is dead.
nyway u don't see me goin on bout it.
not a single person in my family is able to recognise me as mildly funny.
the roles they give us are forever lol 
Ooooof
one day we will live in a world brave enough to tackle greek mythology.
Everyone's talking about these Sirens!

"me as an annoying millennial comic/just me right now,"

I've been hearing a lot about these men crashing their boats on the aegean after hearing a woman scream.
I'm not surprised...that tends to happen when u hear  a REAL ORGASM for the first time.  -
"me as a sassy woman comic,"
ancient greece.
"What's with all these men goin out to sea,"
crashin their boats after hearing Siren screams?

thanks friend :)
my life is one long hide and seek with (i'm convinced)
a single uniball pen
yeah this is just everyone we've been making fun of already right &gt;.&gt;
In my short law work life I saw the huge difference having lawyers from diverse backgrounds made to clients/victims.
And how blind so much legislation is to ppl on the margins.
These changes entrench the worst of the existing system.
This.
I barely became a lawyer cause of how toxic the corporate/white culture at law school was.
I worked mainly in the community sector &amp;
have a giant HECS bill I'm nowhere near paying off.
Lucky I'm an artist now 
oh for sure!
i meant recognition of it from 'establishment'
it's also just not true on numbers alone!
"plus,"
the work encouraged by diversity grants has mostly been about mandating art that responds whiteness/didactic trauma narratives etc.

ur stuck with me like a grimy little boil that never bursts or heals yum yum.  
talked briefly to about the underlying racism of our industry.
i talk about something i usually never do:
feeling like quitting.
but i think it's a normal response to these structures to have those thoughts and we shouldn't be ashamed of them 
very rude of some of u to be both racist &amp;
sexist.

Thanks for sharing this.

Hard disagreeeee 
love this @_budgie
what a great idea x
Yuppp 
Yeah for me it's the others laughing along and saying equally odd stuff.
It's a picture of a culture -
what parties and rooms all over must look like.
it's coming 
whiteness will use the 'capitalism'
excuse a lot -
"efficiency,"
"industry standards,"
the way it works etc.
my saddest moments are when BIPOC internalise these and replicate them.
never!
to sign on to that platform again?...i have a life to live
We're gonna change this shit x
"I was in a room with a really prominent white theatre director who sighed and said 'theyre just not on our level,"
maybe in a few years'
never stopping to think that maybe ur level is the same boring shit and should change.
A .
Open casting call in Tasmania broke me.
Like just do a white show about white ppl -
we'll be fine it.
Don't pretend U wanted to be diverse and couldn't find the talent.
yeah why is everyone laughing 
I feel great game writing is so attuned to audience emotion and agency.
Like immersive theatre.
It's what I love about it
I think we're all at diff learning stages at diff times.
Using it as an excuse would be shit -
there's no need to excuse it -
it is what it is.
Growth is more imp -
I care more bout the future changes powerful ppl are resolved to make.
Here if u need to chat xx
i'm sure everyone's had these thoughts -
it's just it's usually at ur friend's party and u can grow in private. -
"i'm trying to call in,"
not out.
being platformed at the opera house is what makes this seem really normal.
and it's not.
because i can't stop ruining my career by saying stuff -
i honestly had full body shiver &amp;
much sadness from this.
"white comedy ppl talking bout being allies,"
if u know the ppl on this panel reach out &amp;
talk to them hey? 2016 was ages ago so i hope they've got more nuance now.
"yeah and the whole 'we can't find diverse actors in tasmania' (when other white ppl in the show weren't cast from tas),"
"or the illogic of 'they're just not around,"
but when i do find them i make them 7/11 ppl'.
it's very...confusing.

enya
This is just to say I destroyed the statues tht were in the public square  Get fucked hey They were so racist And delicious to topple a few horrifying symbols of centuries of violence pass me a plum or some shit ??
gonna need that fructose lift to get rid of these bastards

just tried to imagine being on twitter in 2050
me:
how are all the kids on tik tok so energetic i don't think a single person i knew in high school was this alive  :
no they're just american  me:
o ya i forgot  

"i know,"
it's so hard to comprehend that all the genocidal racists aren't on the same side -
it's like history is complex or something gross like that.
it took a pandemic but my email etiquette has finally changed from the gendered nice tone &amp;
exclamation points to short sentences &amp;
full stops.
and no sign-offs -
where would i be going kunt?
we all live here all the time now.
ahh im not tht suspicious of fun.
if it's doing good and ur getting dopamine go for it.
joy can animate action as much as sadness.
also would advise changing from a statue not a good week for it 
"For instance,"
ppl i've seen enforcing this attitude are usually comfy white women on the left who are excited to prove themselves allies -
I feel like most ppl who are affected by stuff desperately want 'offenders'
to apologise and change so that shit gets better.
oh yeah cancel culture has loads of value.
"speaking out and even shame are useful/important to achieve change in many cases,"
esp for ppl who haven't been heard.
the sections of the left u and I are talking bout are both not those ppl.
sure  but thts clearly not what I'm talking about?
&amp;
obvs ppl who are hurt by someone's past actions have a right to be wary of them unless it's clear  there's been change -
marginalised ppl have enough going on without those gymnastics.
But ppl who pile on for cred like they've always been blameless/
superior is yuk.
Obvs this doesn't go for powerful ppl who've been given loads of community labour and education and refuse to listen (cough Rowling cough).

So I hope you all take a good look at yourselves.
same as it ever was -
"white gatekeepers,"
"a bad culture,"
no properly responsive incentives from broadcasters re:
"development/inclusion,"
few structured industry pathways for most people let alone anyone who doesn't want to spend 6 nights a week in scene that can be toxic to them.

you can't claim historical pride and exclude historical shame -
it's the same source.

Fair warning:
I have lost work cause of speaking up about this in the past/probably will again.
They love to think of us as difficult with the slightest   u gotta play that risk and that's ur choice no judgement 
Emerging BIPOC creators -
hot tip:
anytime someone says to you 'this is how the industry works'
or 'these are the rules'
"to justify ur pain,"
be wary.Treating systems as inviolable laws is the mark of someone who doesn't give a fuck about change.
Australia this is also you.
You're very happy to hire us to give cred to your brainstorms and authenticate 'diverse'
characters (gotta include them cause of funding!)

Carefree and unaware of all the cookedness that was was coming.
But when you look back perhaps the signs were lurking there.  
 
unfortunately I've already begun the sequel:
Lady Fartsquarth lives to fart again.
Sorry to report I have written a novel during this pandemic.
It has been optioned too.
I only sold the rights on the condition I got to play the main character:
Lady Fartsquarth.
I will be taking a method approach to the role.
Guess some of us just can't stop achieving.
it's now acceptable for millennials to join tik-tok but ur telling me this pandemic ISN'T the great leveller??? 
I polymorphed a death knight into a sloth to buy us time to escape from a hellscape prison.

Act 3:
"With fuckboi sorta reforming,"
Dave is hurt &amp;
they stop hanging out.
"Life continues,"
until grandma sneezes.
Fuckboi blanches at leaving the flat but heroine rushes to help.
"In the ER,"
they reconnect &amp;
she apologises.
Grandma lives.
Pandemic lifts.
Big smooch + sex. (3/3)
Act 2:
"Stuck in the apartment,"
it's time to get to know her quirky neighbours.
Including Dave -
a young man who's moved in to help his grandma avoid trips to the market.
They hang out &amp;
hook up -
just once.
But when fuckboi is evicted &amp;
needs a place to crash she takes him in.
Pandemic rom-com.
Hello  Act 1:
She's dating a fuckboi when lockdown hits.
He can't take the distance &amp;
breaks up with her unceremoniously on zoom.
Devastation. (1/3)
Thank you it's a scary time
Dreamt last night that I became a stand-up comic.
Had a high ponytail and a casual mic manner and everything.This self isolation is going to change us in grotesque ways.
!!!! @xantheahere
Didn't mean in the reprisal sense.
Just scomo's speeches being in the ear.
Big deja vu rn.
"they were great disembarking,"
"it was just...the rest of the flight,"
especially cause there was room.
i wonder if in an airplane cause of recycled air if it makes a difference even? :/
On Jetstar this morning there was loads of room yet ppl were seated next to each other (by boking chance) -
staff didn't suggest otherwise.
This living through history thing -
I could really leave it or leave it
aaaargh.
i'm sorry.
it's like being in a labyrinth everyday.
you are the bagel with everything.
so glad to know you.

but what 20 sec song he sing in his head I must know
 
i can't.
hah yeah I'm v.
much joking though.
I have no interest in being vindicated here.
I'm just fucking sad and scared woooo 
Amazing to think how many ppl who thought I was too extra last week now just think I'm correct and very hot.
how is this...social distancing.
Everyone's screenshots of their hangs is some real myspace top 8 energy and I feel like we've gone through too much to live through this again.
Loll
 are you listening?
"South Korea,"
Taiwan &amp;
Singapore:  Hi we have great proven measures you can take immediately to stop this horrifying pandemic destroying your country.  Australia:  
@BaldwinAlistair
here for this
Yeah I would rather not be feeling like I'm watching a real time royal commission discovery.
I hate it so much
Yay for the city of lit office existing honestly.
It's ok.
I will find a way to haunt ur dreams xx
I want to shout-out the team at griffin including for their leadership here.
Behind the scenes their comms to programmed artists (like me)
"has been swift,"
"clear,"
financially prudent and very generous.
Really rare tbh. 
"Yeah so my boy William Shakespeare may have wrote ""king lear"""

Great thread.
Esp for our government that seems to be veering away from suppression and mitigation.
Feels like something for  ?
Can WA enforce self-isolation of inter-state travellers for 2 weeks?
Everyone needs to watch WA AMA president  news conference now.
"I'm honestly tearing up at getting clear,"

Can we emerge from this with - -

the end of this government -
more union support/
valuing of workers -
more research &amp;
hospital funding -
appreciation for the arts sector's work -
better accessibility everywhere &amp;

glad i could help i guesssss
omg can't believe i didn't sign this rupi kauronavirus.
this is how distressed i am!!!!1
how do i put this in a way the internet can understand:  my family didn't  come across the oceans to gasp for breath without a ventilator during coronavirus hospital overload while the young oblivious oppressors partied at a bar  -
RuPi kAuR
this is why a lot of people will find  paranoid if u try to discuss this with them.
also nobody likes being afraid.
let's be kind but also if u get it don't give up talking about it.
True!
we are not innately able to understand risk.
it was a hard lesson in law school tobe trained to look at everything that way.
artists are if anything trained the opposite -
u need to run on blind optimism.
anyway we're in a mess.
I honestly cannot deal.
"As we have seen,"
simply living to shit. 
Are you kidding me with this Hillsong conference gathering?
Thousands of people packed into an arena on the eve of a mass event ban?
ur an absolute disgrace.
Isn't the protocol to isolate while you're waiting for your results and not potentially pass it on to a bunch of school kids who could spread it in their community?
What are you doing??
I'm so sorry Sarah.
I've been following your vital work about aged care and appreciate it so much.
Wishing you strength and comfort at this time.

and to you 
No it's great you're writing them.
"Please don't think of the actions required of you in the next while as ""giving up on life"""

Aunty noooo  
I need to hear this origin story.
Y'all this mummy was trying to tell us something about the year.
This sound is 2020.
I hate this 
"I cannot handle another post shared about how  ""it's just the flu"""
"or ""heart disease kills more ppl"""
I actually think this is an indictment on science education (apart from the rampant ableism).
I wanna acknowledge tht I haven't cancelled ny of my shows coz venue contracts are nightmares &amp;
will bankrupt artists who cancel first.
This why it's on the ppl in charge to lead.
Workers will go to work cause of the consequences.
But I don't want to be part of the problem.
"ok beyond parody i've literally seen 3 posts in the last day along the lines of ""don't panic about the pandemic at home alone,"
"come to my talk!"""
we're wimpsssss.

I went on this podcast last year &amp;
"instead of the usual reductive shtick it was actually so nice and rare to get to freewheel about representation,"
"bots,"
"class,"
capitalism &amp;
diaspora.
Have a listen if you like!  
"Recognise the individual is no longer the most liberatory unit of subjectivity...it might be time to not be afraid of being part of a crowd,"
to return to the nameless and faceless mass.
Love this new piece by  
"Extremely cool that the hindu Swastik,"
"appropriated by Nazis,"
is now being used by Hindu nationalists in a similar fashion.
It's like history is an ouroboros of horror.
This is wild and somehow also completely sensical in this the year of screech 2020.
i know nepotism in the arts gross but sometimes all i want to do is get opportunities so i can eventually give my talented overlooked friends work and we can all have a great time forever.
this weak-ass spirit  is probs why i'm being dacked by capitalism on the daily.
Lol meant searing but it works.

...the resources offered are usually tokenistic anyway.
"So what do organisations actually offer,"
is it just clout?
Does this clout only resonate with middle class people?  Loved seering honesty in this interview!
Rare and needed.

same!
ur the cutest
Ah yes.
Heading back to perth for summer to recharge as the worst version of myself for a whole new year.
all you need to know about me: -
the low immunity &amp;
persistent cough of a period drama family's untalented younger sibling. -
"into gigs,"
"long walks by the beach,"
galleries. -
the handsome &amp;
rock-hard ass of a period drama family's overworked horse.
thank you.
i have the immunity of an untalented younger sibling in a period romance novel.

how did our health system cope when all the azns mysteriously left their jobs?
was nina ever crying at love or was she really crying from the ptsd of rebuilding medicare after the great azn exodus i.e. 'the event'?????
you may hav thought this show was about a quirky blonde doctor but really it was a masterclass in shadow storytelling.
each ep carefully heightened the horror.
what had happened to all the asians?
had their parents been mind controlled into telling them they could do whatever?
after all these years i'm still shook by the dystopic channel 10 show that was Offspring.
its nonchalant depiction of an inner-city melbourne hospital with no asians was the eeriest of spec fic takes.

Hey poets!
A reminder tht u have 2 weeks to get in touch.

these are not a ppl oppressed by social norms.
norms like not coughing in my face during peak hour &amp;
not coughing in my face before or after peak hour either.
blessed to be around such revolutionaries 
hey bb
both are used in civil but complainant is usually used: -
"for tribunals (so not ""court court"") -"
before trial (pre-trial)
sometimes of course it bleeds because ppl and language but...would never use plaintiff for a tribunal proceeding.
so there is that hard line.
ethical non-monotony:
"if u bore me,"
i send u an article on community gardening or sustainable fashion instead of ever talking to u again.
fuck this guy.
"awake at 5 am,"
"yelling at netflix on twitter,"
this is the most relaxed i've been in weeks.
"no i cannot ""skip the recap"""
"for Riverdale because while i may have watched every single episode of this godforsaken show,"
"including last week's,"
i still have no idea what the fuck is going on.
i need all the recap i can get because it's fucking RIVERDALE.  #RiverdaleCW
a level of no chill i can only aspire to
"very difficult question in theatre,"

course now i work in the arts &amp;
do none of these things hahah.
here's another secret:
"all institutional spaces have the same issues,"
it just morphs.
there's no utopian place tht will value u on decent terms or where u won't feel judged by outside forces.
we make tht ourselves?
i was a pretty good lawyer though.
the 2 things are not related!
i found great satisfaction in the actual work.
it was a privilege to help ppl navigate difficult systems.
don't let this moment determine ur future potential!
ur intelligence &amp;
compassion will find expression.
seeing a lotta law school mental health stuff on my TL at the moment.

if you were a girl and had a crush on ian thorpe in primary school you're queer now i don't make the rules go swim a lap
i think it comes from this misguided view of needing art or cultural products to be policy document -
which probably speaks to a broader social issue/feeling of loss.
a response from a place of fear.

rly enjoyed this review
snide into my DMs
Thank u for articulating what no one was brave enough to
i see the bad show #Riverdale is back.
once more to the hole i must go -
to lie down with the worms &amp;
watch this unholy vision week on week:
"shitting myself,"
"feeding the worms,"
wondering what went wrong in my life that i can't tear myself away.
caaaaan't wait!!!!
my tolerance for trash is so high and yet ---  maybe watching the anglo bullies from high school trying to hook up is too alienating or something.
yeah being a brown-ass immigrant was bad but being unable to summon the will to engage in bachelor tv culture in any way is a whole other level of otherness.
i have never felt more alone.

yay smart art writing 
Are u speaking of all post offices or of... 
i'd like to write about this in a better form than twitter someday though.
good morning.
it is me.
a 90 yr old grumps in the body of a young artist. 
the canon's full of solitary straight white men we've put on plinths.
they're falling off now which is gr8.
but is the answer to calcify marginal artists the same way?
what would celebrating collectives look like?
or more nuanced discussion around making?
"less plinth,"
more party.
"when we go to art to reify a person,"
we're saying it doesn't belong to all of us.
that we all don't have a stake in making culture.
that gatekeepers know best.
fuck that line of thinking.
this messianic view of an individual is dangerous.
and neoliberal at root -
"buying into the lie of atomised brilliance/responsibility,"
and branding.
"i am less interested in someone's individual trajectory,"
than in the ways their work opens out to others and the world.
lolllll lisa already made this joke.
it's like u are a couple or something.
so much of arts journalism is bout fetishising the bright new thing.
the trend or young artist on the rise who will solve all our problems somehow.
it just reflects broader culture:
"we aren't comfortable with people who've had messy lives,"
or with acknowledging advantage.
"good morning,"
"i have just discovered a Moray is ""a mainly nocturnal eel-like predatory fish of warm seas,"
"which typically hides in crevices with just the head protruding."""
"love to add new strong,"
independent women to my roster of role models!  
so great.
this is tearing me up 
time to move??
ahahhahahha *australian tears*
Still not over the IRONY of this misogynist alt-righter trolling us for making a fun show bout feminism &amp;

#Riverdale writers:
Should we really introduce a surprise twin twist...isn't that hacky?
One minute late:
"It'll all be fine as long as we call it a 'modern day Romulus and Remus',"
that's super high-brow. 30 secs later:
But also it all takes place at the reading of a secret will!
I honestly think all of Riverdale's problems would be solved if everyone just left #Riverdale once in a while.
Just go visit a new town.
Check it out.
I hear Providence is beautiful this time of year.
If the people of #Riverdale don't say the word Riverdale every six minutes do they just explode?

I haven't finished the book though because I started making this salad by retrieving the lemons from my grandmother's birth place in mykonos and i left the book there when we visited but what i didn't leave behind was my three kids who really love this salad!!
end them all please and just open a tin of chickpeas and tip it down my gullet
The sourness of the lemons required for this chickpea salad reminds me of the fifth chapter of Anna Karenina which is a book my husband got me on our third anniversary which was exactly five years ago last week! -

Thanks  for including our show on the don't miss list!
I can't wait to share it with you.  
Thrilled to be part of this line-up of incredibly exciting work.
I want to see everyone's shows so bad.  
yes they were months apart but also completely related in a way i can't remember now because of my great fall.
beware!
"hey i pitched something once and then i fell and developed a concussion,"
be careful.

"wedding pinterest,"
you are my straightest downfall.
i have sometimes had disdain or skepticism from gatekeepers that i have a professional degree or sometimes have to do other work for months on end to not be in living stress.
as if that reduces my seriousness as an artist.
how nice it must be to sneer at this lol.
"and there are obviously lots of factors that go into why this is so,"
"esp compared to the states,"
but definitely the cultural and monetary permission to not spend your early twenties in an office so as to not alarm ur migrant family/be broke.....is a part of it.
i was talking to a v.
"amazing american artist last nite,"
who's here for fringe with her solo show &amp;
she said 'why are there so many people in their twenties here doing solo shows?
i mean not just what can they possibly have to say but like how?
also why are they all white?'
"i should be used to it by now,"
but i am never not taken aback by the amount of people in the arts who don't have to work other jobs. $$$ is the arts diversity problem we don't talk about.
"but also srsly,"
wud these babies even be so woke if it weren't for all our tumblrs.
hmm??????

bye.

do we stop because as an adult you're supposed to be able to express yourself in your own words.

imagine doing that now on fb or twitter.
so naff.

is there a term for uncomfortable poc nostalgia for the really really white suburbs you grew up in?

trust u to choose the most swifty moment of the show to focus on
i didn't think it was possible but Riverdale got so lugubriously trashy that it somehow looped around to feminist ass-kicking again. #Riverdale
i just cackled out loud.
I COLd.
is this show written by tumblr algorithm. #Riverdale
i don't know if u can really say i'm *watching*
"Riverdale anymore,"
so much as i'm *stabbing myself in the head with a spoon*
as Riverdale plays through the ether. #Riverdale
i was a feminist from day dot.
"growing up in a super conservative/patriarchal diaspora,"
small and big things stung with inequality.
"hated it,"
"scowled,"
wanted to overthrow.
Throw it in the bin
Why would it take so long to count?
Surely you just see which pile is bigger?
What is this shit? -
my housemate on the plebiscite
crying &amp;
fuming in a cafe reading this v.imp piece.
fellow women &amp;
woc performers pls take a minute:  
great series of writing/cultural nights kicking off at nida melbourne soon;
check it out!   @NIDACommunity
ever closer to my final form of bat wife  
tldr:
everyone deserves to freefall thru life with the cheerful &amp;
aggressively unreflective idiocy of a bertie wooster.
put another way u cud also say that the greatest evil of these 'isms'
is that they kill ur authorship.
the enjoyment of an unmediated life.
there's that toni morrison quote bout the greatest evil of racism being it stealing ur time.
"i'm speaking here of discrete acts of violence,"
but course all the above applies to social systems tht ppl on the margins can be born into.
this is how trauma becomes a continuum.
u become a mirror person -
"still moving through life,"
but with some odd sense that u do not own urself.
"u may want to react a certain way,"
but instead u find ur body &amp;
mind are in conversation with a threat that u might have thought long gone.
"when u have been transgressed,"
"u lose faith in the truth of ur responses,"
in ur self without realising.
i would see in some of my work with victims of violence this ongoing abnegation.
the incredible fatigue of fear &amp;
vigilance.
"i've been thinking a lot bout this post-weinstein i guess,"
but also always.
the thing about trauma is it makes u a body in response.
u wander the world in a state of reaction.
u lose a protagonist's autonomy &amp;
ease.

Hate tht its real x
oh fffff
anything lawyers can do now kon?

yeah that's how i roll.
i'm a liberated gal who does wht she wants.
crying is sexy right.
it's no IT crowd.
which is the only one tht can do tht.
always feel bad tht i never hav party tricks at parties.
but just remembered i can recite lengthy sanskrit prayers &amp;
make ppl uncomfortable.
is lynchian comedy of manners an acceptable response 4 'describe your practice'?  i h8 art.
ah sunday eve! -
time to don my finest gown &amp;
laugh in the mirror like a giddy heiress on the eve of a bloody revolution.
or time to chips.
the other explanation is of course to make hermione look better.
"in which case,"
she doesn't need tht help.
and also ewwwwww.
like it can't be that the producers never met a desi girl right.
cause that's the only explanation.
we wouldn't be caught in tht basic shit.
"ever so often,"
"from out of nowhere,"
a blind hot flash of rage at parvati &amp;
padma patil's outfits in the yule ball scene.  #harrypotter
Guys we were right
"A panellist -""Enough of irony."
"Isn't it time for the New Sincerity?""  Um isn't that just sincerity?"
Wtfffff.

"yes pop tate is a separate genre because i can't deal with whatever is happening in that diner,"
form and content wise.
"hi it's me,"
your friendly neighbourhood legally trained killjoy.
"why did jughead's dad need to hang up the phone so quickly,"
he's in prison not in the middle of a typhoon. #Riverdale
"just tonight we've had prison break,"
"chick flick,"
"victorian gothic,"
"true detective,"
"after school special,"
"and of course,"
pop tate.
a good drinking game during #Riverdale is to spot the new genre.
swear it changes every eight minutes.
Jughead:
I'm gonna be vulnerable for once cause I'm facing sthing horrific.
Archie:
Coooool how does my hair look in this shot? #riverdale

'Agree to disagree'
"said the praying mantis eating its lover's head. 'You think this is homicide,"
but i call it love.'
I've rarely heard 'agree to disagree'
without it being laced with some kind of violence or power imbalance.

yes!
or the ze little grey cells point to temple.
*fidgety poirot moustache twirl*
omg perfect choices.
how did i not sense the presence of a fellow christie head?
um i need this shirt.
tldr:
everything is profane.
i'm a grinch.
donate to services for victims of abuse.
and im not even going to start on how sacralisation around art is also a gatekeeper mechanism for diverse voices/art practices.
which is fine.
but the left can be blind to the seduction.
just coz something gives u meaning doesn't mean it can't or shudnt be discarded.
'our shared humanity''transcendent' 'otherworldly' 'connects us to something greater' -
the language of book/film reviews &amp;
spirituality.
but this is also what makes it so easy to hijack for shitty purposes.
"like,"
"i guess,"
religious institutions.
i think it's commonly read as a response to increase of secular sentiment.
so we need these special experiences.
the sacralisation of art sometimes feels to me like a big conspiracy.
we can all survive without your art.
stop assaulting women you bunch of fucknuggets.
i'm not sure why there's always a conversation about whether it's more important to be a good artist than a good human being.
Fashion tips for predominantly white spaces:

It's like they know just how to make me jealous.

But after the passing of Galadriel in a few years Celeborn grew weary of his realm and went to dwell with the sons of Elrond.

they reflect.

a tiny voice whispering on the wind:
oimnotliketheotherguiiiiisssseeeeeeeeeeee
"on a quiet nights,"
"if i strain my ears,"
i can still hear his fleet-footed step speeding out the door and sometimes
but deep down i know -
"in that moment of what appeared like vertiginous cowardice,"
he actually  achieved moksha and transcended this realm
i never heard from him again after that night.
some say he moved to Canberra.
"perhaps he was really more enlightened than the rest of us,"
perhaps he had achieved a oneness of feeling and action i could only dream of
like it was amazing to see someone so at one with their symbolic and physical selves
and all i remember thinking was 'wtf'
and also kind of admiring his commitment to making the metaphor of running away so unmetaphorical

honestly articles like this make me feel so gaslit bout shouting this stuff in media rooms &amp;
arts institutions for yrs &amp;
being dismissed.
"so wild that those who seemingly define the culture are actually yrs behind it.  (nyway um some of the language in this...""head wobbles""..ok)  "
hope ur doing ok &lt;3
lotta live art discourse is bout wht the performing body already signifies.
"this sort of casting often comes from refusing 2 replicate harm in a representational way,"
"the body on stage already carries it,"
"the audience comes with it,"
it's theatre -
imagine it etc.
"not commenting on the rest of this as i haven't seen the work,"
but i feel increasingly there's interesting discourse disjuncture in how contemporary performance understands casting vs.
in lit-criticism...
So sorry Josh 
ugh such a classic reviewer response to anything that doesn't centre a minority trauma (like idk...maybe the intended audience for this work gets it and doesn't need it replicated in full to understand it as a force in the story)
exactly this !

This production ofAlibrandiachieves what most stage adaptations can only dream of;

shout out to the gen z bb in the front row who laughed at all my jokes then promptly turned to discuss them loudly with her friend like they were watching netflix at home.
it made the show super difficult but i kind of just wanted to give their damaged pandemic brains a hug.

Hi
If you want to see Respawn at Comedy Festival a few accessible options might suit: 1) 21st April show will be in person and live streamed 2)  20th April will be Auslan interpreted 3)
For lift/wheelchair access i'm doing an extra show 19th April 9pm at Trades Hall in Carlton.  
just cheeky like that sorry!

i want to report i got on a tram and heard a guy say 'everything happens for a reason'

and something didn't break in you in the last two years...honestly you terrify me

well it's not just about me!
something i hear and see a lot.
really feeling the fatigue from a bunch of artists atm.
yeah as if the whole thing didn't run on the energy and labour of artists.
also there are so many automations around it now that it's kind of wilful to not!
you will never convince me -
"if ur a grant body,"
"casting agent,"
arts org -
that it was too hard to send a rejection email.
i say this as someone who's had to send them too.
that this smallest of courtesies is lacking in our industry speaks to the whole tbh.
yes but who is the resource daddy (person most likely to become a tech billionaire)

I've completely changed sides in the bad art friend debate.

at this point the most on brand thing for this country would be to announce Pauline Hanson as a contestant on the first series of australian taskmaster

A little preview of my video for tonight's launch.
Don't worry it's not just this for an hour (there are also a bunch of other great artists to raise the tone!)   
I think I made a new friend today and it was so overstimulating I'm ready to cry!
Yeah 2021!!

Congrats bec!
also couples from manjimup shud get money to invigorate their music scenes just as a sound artist in the inner north might -
"but  if they need more production/planning support to do so maybe,"
there should be schemes that help that along!
not ones that function by whim.
"the amount of money isn't the issue,"
its the transparency of decision making and criteria especially in contrast with other usual processes and in a keeling industry (which of course we can talk about as inadequate and restrictive in criteria too)
that's a different issue though.
"and yes,"
sucks.
this scheme is not widening access in any meaningful way if you look at it.

"oh i agree,"
hence the perhaps -
"i wanted to direct it o most ppl likely reading this in my feed/art circles have probably benefited from and sustained the system by having abundance in some form at some time,"
myself included.
"that's a great point.  it does feel we have internalised failure or a lack of sellable outcomes as negative,"
"or ""waste""."
also which artists thrive when everyone else feels stretched?
"the most secure,"
someone with abundance.
"at times,"
we've all perhaps been that person -
but few can sustain it.
but many of us feel wrong if we can't-
how can u kill this thought when the institution rewards it?
i fully understand they are trying to communicate with a hostile funding environment/a sceptical audience. &amp;
yes  art is usually good for you.
"but artists are not emergency workers, &amp;"
"it is bit gross when salaried,"
secure ppl sculpt them into that to keep their positions alive.
"i get that it's a response to an environment where art events have to justify their investment or existence,"
and like 'good for u'
"is an easy sell,"
but yeah.
not into the marketing vibe from festivals/orgs re:
artists are always resilient/
will create work no matter what/&amp;
that the arts can heal people right now.
we aren't doctors -
in pay or training.
weaponising the language of duty is really short-sighted.

What a cheering way to end the year.
"A month ago I could not run 5k without feeling exhausted,"
but with the help of this app I have completely forgotten that feeling  It is an interior decorating app.

it's the cosmic blast for me.
i thought we had a few more years till the rich haunted us with holograms.

maybe we need more compassion for the conspiracy weirdos.
it's clear they never had the chance to get into RPGs growing up and are acting out by LARPing bad dystopian novels now.
"be a GM,"

Happy to report I have stuck to my promise 
yuck I'm so sorry Carly.
It boggles my mind that someone could be so mean but also how much effort and time has gone into this -
you could have gone full sourdough starter instead lady.
It might be boring

It's what we talked bout hey 
"If ur Australian,"
NZ feels like tht cousin ur family loves to mention -
"the one who speaks at the UN,"
"got married last yr,"
then started a not for profit in their spare time.
Meanwhile ur trying to find money to register for a digital fringe.
Every one can relate to this analogy.

anyone who has hung out with the graduates of these schools would know this is a huge waste of money.

"react to them,"

yes it's true.

aussie liberals starting to weaponise mental health with the same hypocrisy of u.s.
pro-lifers.
the biggest threats to mental health result from their policies:
"insecure workplaces and housing,"
"robodebt,"
"climate change,"
privatised healthcare...the lack of fresh air isn't it
that was such a good night.
and weirdly prescient of the 5g storm to come hey.

an extra hour of light but think of the real costs.
it encourages ppl to believe we are in control of sunlight..to believe tht the universe doesn't tend to entropy?.. &amp;

so comorbidity -
if i possess a juicy butt tht attracts a baboon to my side who bites me-
"i died of baboon bite,"
not of juicy butt.
maybe someday the sheer juiciness of my butt would have drowned and killed me.
"But that's speculative,"
unlike the vicious baboon.

thank u i am thrilled to be the recipient of this year's collyer prize
i'm sorry it feels very clear that it should be me?
"not sure where the confusion is,"
"i have entered nothing and i have nothing to enter into anything,"
but it is still  wrong that i have not won a prize.
do i know what sort of prize it could be?
absolutely not.
that would require knowing what it is that i do.
should i still have one?
"yes,"
a thousand times yes.
Which bar??

emphasis on individual action as well as scepticism of medical advice may also make it risky during the current pandemic moment...ask whether social media's fetish for the healthy individual still serves us.

maybe the bad housemate could hog that.

save it for the stream!!!!!
gonna start a twitch stream where i just watch me and my friend's old family videos and try and catch the moment they developed anxiety.
ugh why don't u just come to my house and make my dad disappointed to MY FACE
Every brigade of zealous stans reflects a deep cultural sickness:
a pervasive alienation that drives people to attach their own senses of self to imagined ideas of famous strangers.   once again loving writing on comedy &amp;

Which pls
 
Congrats to the annoyingly talented for making this long list with his very good short stories

"wrote this for american father's day,"

happy pandemic dad's day aussie dads 
i wanna live everyday with the abandon of the girl from my high school who is wishing her husband happy father's day on his public facebook wall.
this cat is perfect for you.
these lockdown protesting kunts really be like  
I hate this so much
I kno a truly just world is foolish because when I don't reply to emails it's always because I am a delicate beautiful lamb but when others don't it's because they are  made from Devil taint.
No amount of awareness of this contradiction has changed my mind.
We're all doomed.
I wrote a very silly parody once where I played Elon Musk's defence lawyer on Mars.
He had merged with a Tesla to live on eternally and was trying to get out of a parking ticket.
Everyday this seems less unlikely.
American political figures starting podcasts right now is big Nero fiddle energy.
that's all you needed to say.

we will do a special shout-out/personalised cancellation to you in our next stream.

doc:
ok ur cells literally cannot carry around anything right now.

i guess we'll never know.
Wtfff.
I hate this so much.
"Yes but I'm usually like good for u,"
being so organised.
omg.

i'm very afraid i'm going to do it for no money.

do this
I think bout this often lol.
So glad it's not just me.
I think like many terms when ur functioning in Anglo contexts ppl latch onto it as a kind of belonging/identifier before examining what it says bout their communities.
I think  its common when uve been trained to be reductive and there's movement away from it now.
No...wht is this
what have i woken upto
so good.
the only game of jeopardy there should be

oof no.

"my love language is sending my partner links to thinkpieces that look cool,"
"waiting 10 minutes,"

And I wish him well on that journey.
This man is one month away from becoming a found sound artist.

sorry to hear this.
I don't know if this is what ur asking for or is helpful but I've been finding singing along to Toad sings very cathartic for bad feelings:  
ok only if it pays equity though
remembered i pitched a 'sovereign citizens'
play to a major theatre company 5 years ago &amp;
they were like O_O. &amp;
now look -
it's the zeitgeist!
who's laughing now hey??
no one.
"i didn't finish the play,"
ur company is probs collapsing &amp;
the sovereign citizens are ruining all of us.
Ah 2020.

"i'm sorry everyone,"
please visit brianna's financial healing business.
i especially love her tagline -
Be the bri you wish to intuitively financial heal in the world.
"about six years ago,"
i knew a woman who started an intuitive financial healing business.
"today,"
she is an anti-masker &amp;
anti-vaxxer who believes governments are conspiring to control us.
"i don't have anything to say about this,"
i just needed to type it out to take it in.
"can confirm scott loves this show with his whole heart + is a very funny writer who loves devising strange,"
silly games.
also is good to work with/not a cunt!
"it reminds me of a theatresports game so,"
"yes,"
you're right.
i'm guessing i'm not one.
wtf is a lowercase girl I'M GOING TO EAT YOU ALL
the cult of '40 under 40'
or '12 tweens who will kick u in the face tomorrow'

some young ppl have to work or are sold to a witch as a human trash-can &amp;
this is fine!
all the bin-juice i accumulated only made my work moister &amp;
the witch is actually v.

Its become one of the many COVID cliches that the virus finds any weakness.
"And in an insecure labour market,"
"at a time of economic stagnation,"
"and in the forgotten pockets of Australia that were never in it together,"
it found just that.   
"now that calendars are useless,"
i'm measuring time by my thirst phases for diff cast members of hamilton.
Oo thnk u
honestly where do you begin with someone who is convinced that covid is a conspiracy?
is there some kind of grad cert in talking to ppl who are living in a diff reality?

obsessed with tht supreme karen at bunnings saying it's her right according the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights as a living woman to enter the store.
a woman who lives.
a living woman.
a woman who lives.
"living,"
she does it.
"to live,"

"I had a clowning joke,"

In deux years if you are not a pathetic worm you may experience the joke or as we say the joy of le jeuuu!!!
"I had a diverse writer joke,"
but i'll let the white showrunner tell it because she could fire me.

i'm worried for the pretty lady.
I was on this morning at 5.45 am blurrily telling terrible stories from my life!
Have a listen at 1h45min if you hate harry potter.
Or just listen to the whole show because it's wonderful and which part of the day isn't breakfast anymore rly?  
That's awesome.
UoM has some of the structure that universities can bring.
"In my exp,"
art spaces with commercial imperatives slip through a lot of regulative loops/have a culture that's super different and hidden and easy to create exploitation in.
so common and I'm furious about it

Aaaand the godfather's back!  I hope these two can actually meet up sometime when things are calmer.
A baby should know its godfather.   good night!

"How can you say millennials aren't resilient when we've survived two economic downturns,"

but i won't be persecuted for who i am.
my lived experience is that I hated normal people and that's that.
Lol i work from home with an immunocompromised person in the house -
wrap me in overprudence!!
quite apart from that no one I know is having parties 
Mmmmm  
All I wanna do is go to a party in a tight silver dress and say inebriated and painfully sincere things to people I barely know.
I already requested u.
The game is afoot.
babe we're not even Facebook friends! (which come to think of it is enough to write you down in the book how dare)
every aspect of this is very satisfying to me.
Literally everyday is just another article from an old rich person wailing that it's inconvenient for them to have to not treat people like dogshit anymore.
I'm furious for you and myself as an ally
Jack would it help u to know there are people doing events who've never even written a book and have only done like a play or a web series???
Hope this helps

it's easy to sneer when things don't affect u hey.
I want ppl who think we're performative to know most of us do the work.
For eg.
this month alone i've written recs for cultural reform to 2 arts bodies + 1 carer org.
This was not fun &amp;
took time I don't have.
None of us think twitter yelling is the whole convo..
I'm really sorry.
Wishing you and your family all the strength you need right now.
Sadly I have only nice things to say about U 
"there's this group of girls i know who are really into wishing each other happy birthday on social media and it's very sweet but also if someone did that to me I'd be like ""I get it bitch I'm gonna die someday!!"""

This is perfect news. @indignant_ant
im sorry but if theatre kids don't mock music theatre kids once a year and vice versa we will all turn to stage dust.
i should not have watched hamilton twice in two days.
i literally can't hear what anyone is saying in conversation anymore.
the singing is inside me and very loud and constant.
is this what it's like to be a music theatre kid i'm so sorry.
 
srsly.
Maybe it's a writing critique.
The walkleys were too loud on the subtext.
We need nuanced tweets that allow readers to uncover the structures of a brand run industry on their own terms.
Stick together to do what?

please tell me to get fucked.
There's a real type on this website.
"Older self-identified ""lefties"""

It's so bizarre.
i'm a big fan of the word vibe too.

not acceptable.
it's work &amp;

"Thus it is like any industry,"
"but with even less accountability,"
"lax codes of conduct,"
few guidelines around complaint or resolution.the basics really.
"ppl think working in the arts is bout amazing creative energies coming together,"

this was so on point.
thank you.
this is so startlingly rare i think i just teared up.

Fingers crossed!!
Most of the ppl speaking up now aren't doing so cause they're opportunistic internet bandits.
"It's cause we feel emboldened,"
a safety/relief in numbers.
If ur impulse is to see it as bandwagon that's part of the silence problem.
Ur fine 
I will report back 
Thank you for clarifying!
I honestly believe most apologies and think ppl want to be better.
But I am a pretty deranged and probs foolish optimist tht way.
I think ppl want to see evidence of understanding of harm plus some future actions.
I think the latter is the hardest bit.
My circle is discussing how to suck off an interdimensional being so we can get the fuck out of here.

my issue is with ppl who defend and de-centre the actual harm/
paint ppl as aggressors for complaining.
not saying white women can't be sad or remorseful -
just be aware that often it makes ppl minimise POC pain.
Think of it like a bad superpower.
yeah my problem is never with someone fucking up but in how POC are so easily painted as aggressors for bringing up issues.
And this is one sad sub facet of that -
u always hope marginality will lead to shared alliances right?
so it's worse when it doesn't.
not about Eliza -
actually haven't tuned into that lol.
"is a general and def historical trend,"
and I'm thinking of a few industry examples tbh.
anyone who knows me knows I'm not bout cancelling ppl -
I know ur learning and make mistakes -
i've just too often seen no real remorse or change as soon as these bird women seem sad.
Meanwhile POC aren't allowed to be sad or difficult.
Solidarity can be better than this please!!
I duno I read some public FB page comments lately and...yeh
once i drunk a full glass of water with my one beak.
it was the summer i was a crane.
those were the days!
"throw ur neck back,"
"quick sip,"
take flight.
the world's not wht it used to be.for one the sorceress who made me a summer-crane is dead.
nyway u don't see me goin on bout it.
not a single person in my family is able to recognise me as mildly funny.
the roles they give us are forever lol 
Ooooof
one day we will live in a world brave enough to tackle greek mythology.
Everyone's talking about these Sirens!
"If I'd known sitting on a rock and screaming would get me all this attention,"
I wouldn't have gone to drama school yikes.  -
"me as an annoying millennial comic/just me right now,"
ancient greece/melbourne.
I've been hearing a lot about these men crashing their boats on the aegean after hearing a woman scream.
I'm not surprised...that tends to happen when u hear  a REAL ORGASM for the first time.  -
"me as a sassy woman comic,"
ancient greece.
"What's with all these men goin out to sea,"
crashin their boats after hearing Siren screams?
Hey if u want a screeching woman to drive u to ur death so bad u shud just spend time with my wife -
and she's on land boys!!!  -
"me as an open-mic comic,"
ancient greece.
The Real Entwives of Fangorn.  I'm sorry.
"in a way,"
i never left my 8th birthday party at mcdonalds.
"i am eating a lot of fries,"
"and from every corner a white man clown smiles at me and does nothing for my health,"
or party vibes.
thanks friend :)
my life is one long hide and seek with (i'm convinced)
a single uniball pen
yeah this is just everyone we've been making fun of already right &gt;.&gt;
In my short law work life I saw the huge difference having lawyers from diverse backgrounds made to clients/victims.
And how blind so much legislation is to ppl on the margins.
These changes entrench the worst of the existing system.
This.
I barely became a lawyer cause of how toxic the corporate/white culture at law school was.
I worked mainly in the community sector &amp;
have a giant HECS bill I'm nowhere near paying off.
Lucky I'm an artist now 
oh for sure!
i meant recognition of it from 'establishment'
it's also just not true on numbers alone!
"plus,"
the work encouraged by diversity grants has mostly been about mandating art that responds whiteness/didactic trauma narratives etc.

yeah there is definitely decolonisation work here.
the funny thing (to me)
is that i probably would have done medicine -
i kinda love it tbh -
if they hadn't made the arts seem not like an option at all unless i got receipts.
love 2 be a rebellious shit 
my dad's so mad about this art degree cost increase -

 please i promise to hire a diverse crew and cast of absolute bitches.
also i'm not going anywhere sorrrry.
ur stuck with me like a grimy little boil that never bursts or heals yum yum.  
talked briefly to about the underlying racism of our industry.
i talk about something i usually never do:
feeling like quitting.
but i think it's a normal response to these structures to have those thoughts and we shouldn't be ashamed of them 
very rude of some of u to be both racist &amp;
sexist.
i have adhd &amp;
can only focus my rage reacts on 1 thing at a time.
get it together bigots 
This is what an ally looks like

Thanks for sharing this.
truly Get Out shit.
Hard disagreeeee 
love this @_budgie
what a great idea x
Yuppp 
Yeah for me it's the others laughing along and saying equally odd stuff.
It's a picture of a culture -
what parties and rooms all over must look like.
it's coming 
whiteness will use the 'capitalism'
excuse a lot -
"efficiency,"
"industry standards,"
the way it works etc.
my saddest moments are when BIPOC internalise these and replicate them.
never!
to sign on to that platform again?...i have a life to live
We're gonna change this shit x
"I was in a room with a really prominent white theatre director who sighed and said 'theyre just not on our level,"
maybe in a few years'
never stopping to think that maybe ur level is the same boring shit and should change.
A .
Open casting call in Tasmania broke me.
Like just do a white show about white ppl -
we'll be fine it.
Don't pretend U wanted to be diverse and couldn't find the talent.
yeah why is everyone laughing 
I feel great game writing is so attuned to audience emotion and agency.
Like immersive theatre.
It's what I love about it
I think we're all at diff learning stages at diff times.
Using it as an excuse would be shit -
there's no need to excuse it -
it is what it is.
Growth is more imp -
I care more bout the future changes powerful ppl are resolved to make.
Here if u need to chat xx
i'm sure everyone's had these thoughts -
it's just it's usually at ur friend's party and u can grow in private. -
"i'm trying to call in,"
not out.
being platformed at the opera house is what makes this seem really normal.
and it's not.
because i can't stop ruining my career by saying stuff -
i honestly had full body shiver &amp;
much sadness from this.
"white comedy ppl talking bout being allies,"
if u know the ppl on this panel reach out &amp;
talk to them hey? 2016 was ages ago so i hope they've got more nuance now.
"yeah and the whole 'we can't find diverse actors in tasmania' (when other white ppl in the show weren't cast from tas),"
"or the illogic of 'they're just not around,"
but when i do find them i make them 7/11 ppl'.
it's very...confusing.

enya
This is just to say I destroyed the statues tht were in the public square  Get fucked hey They were so racist And delicious to topple a few horrifying symbols of centuries of violence pass me a plum or some shit ??
gonna need that fructose lift to get rid of these bastards
had to lie down -
just tried to imagine being on twitter in 2050
me:
how are all the kids on tik tok so energetic i don't think a single person i knew in high school was this alive  :
no they're just american  me:
o ya i forgot  

"i know,"
it's so hard to comprehend that all the genocidal racists aren't on the same side -
it's like history is complex or something gross like that.
it took a pandemic but my email etiquette has finally changed from the gendered nice tone &amp;
exclamation points to short sentences &amp;
full stops.
and no sign-offs -
where would i be going kunt?
we all live here all the time now.
ahh im not tht suspicious of fun.
if it's doing good and ur getting dopamine go for it.
joy can animate action as much as sadness.
also would advise changing from a statue not a good week for it 
"For instance,"
ppl i've seen enforcing this attitude are usually comfy white women on the left who are excited to prove themselves allies -
I feel like most ppl who are affected by stuff desperately want 'offenders'
to apologise and change so that shit gets better.
oh yeah cancel culture has loads of value.
"speaking out and even shame are useful/important to achieve change in many cases,"
esp for ppl who haven't been heard.
the sections of the left u and I are talking bout are both not those ppl.
sure  but thts clearly not what I'm talking about?
&amp;
obvs ppl who are hurt by someone's past actions have a right to be wary of them unless it's clear  there's been change -
marginalised ppl have enough going on without those gymnastics.
But ppl who pile on for cred like they've always been blameless/
superior is yuk.
Obvs this doesn't go for powerful ppl who've been given loads of community labour and education and refuse to listen (cough Rowling cough).

So I hope you all take a good look at yourselves.
same as it ever was -
"white gatekeepers,"
"a bad culture,"
no properly responsive incentives from broadcasters re:
"development/inclusion,"
few structured industry pathways for most people let alone anyone who doesn't want to spend 6 nights a week in scene that can be toxic to them.
"Yep if ur going to attach ur identity to history,"
you can't claim historical pride and exclude historical shame -
it's the same source.

Fair warning:
I have lost work cause of speaking up about this in the past/probably will again.
They love to think of us as difficult with the slightest   u gotta play that risk and that's ur choice no judgement 
Emerging BIPOC creators -
hot tip:
anytime someone says to you 'this is how the industry works'
or 'these are the rules'
"to justify ur pain,"
be wary.Treating systems as inviolable laws is the mark of someone who doesn't give a fuck about change.
Australia this is also you.
You're very happy to hire us to give cred to your brainstorms and authenticate 'diverse'
characters (gotta include them cause of funding!)
but won't give an inch otherwise.
Yeah this is common sense.

omg can't believe i didn't sign this rupi kauronavirus.
this is how distressed i am!!!!1
how do i put this in a way the internet can understand:  my family didn't  come across the oceans to gasp for breath without a ventilator during coronavirus hospital overload while the young oblivious oppressors partied at a bar  -
RuPi kAuR
this is why a lot of people will find  paranoid if u try to discuss this with them.
also nobody likes being afraid.
let's be kind but also if u get it don't give up talking about it.
True!
we are not innately able to understand risk.
it was a hard lesson in law school tobe trained to look at everything that way.
artists are if anything trained the opposite -
u need to run on blind optimism.
anyway we're in a mess.
I honestly cannot deal.
"As we have seen,"

Are you kidding me with this Hillsong conference gathering?
Thousands of people packed into an arena on the eve of a mass event ban?
ur an absolute disgrace.
Isn't the protocol to isolate while you're waiting for your results and not potentially pass it on to a bunch of school kids who could spread it in their community?
What are you doing??
I'm so sorry Sarah.
I've been following your vital work about aged care and appreciate it so much.
Wishing you strength and comfort at this time.

No it's great you're writing them.

Aunty noooo  
I need to hear this origin story.
Y'all this mummy was trying to tell us something about the year.
This sound is 2020.
I hate this 
"I cannot handle another post shared about how  ""it's just the flu"""
"or ""heart disease kills more ppl"""
I actually think this is an indictment on science education (apart from the rampant ableism).
I wanna acknowledge tht I haven't cancelled ny of my shows coz venue contracts are nightmares &amp;
will bankrupt artists who cancel first.
This why it's on the ppl in charge to lead.
Workers will go to work cause of the consequences.
But I don't want to be part of the problem.

"instead of the usual reductive shtick it was actually so nice and rare to get to freewheel about representation,"
"bots,"

Have a listen if you like!  
"Recognise the individual is no longer the most liberatory unit of subjectivity...it might be time to not be afraid of being part of a crowd,"
to return to the nameless and faceless mass.
Love this new piece by  
"Extremely cool that the hindu Swastik,"
"appropriated by Nazis,"
is now being used by Hindu nationalists in a similar fashion.
It's like history is an ouroboros of horror.
This is wild and somehow also completely sensical in this the year of screech 2020.
i know nepotism in the arts gross but sometimes all i want to do is get opportunities so i can eventually give my talented overlooked friends work and we can all have a great time forever.
this weak-ass spirit  is probs why i'm being dacked by capitalism on the daily.
Lol meant searing but it works.

...the resources offered are usually tokenistic anyway.
"So what do organisations actually offer,"
is it just clout?
Does this clout only resonate with middle class people?  Loved seering honesty in this interview!
Rare and needed.

was nina ever crying at love or was she really crying from the ptsd of rebuilding medicare after the great azn exodus i.e. 'the event'?????
you may hav thought this show was about a quirky blonde doctor but really it was a masterclass in shadow storytelling.
each ep carefully heightened the horror.
what had happened to all the asians?
had their parents been mind controlled into telling them they could do whatever?
after all these years i'm still shook by the dystopic channel 10 show that was Offspring.
its nonchalant depiction of an inner-city melbourne hospital with no asians was the eeriest of spec fic takes.

if you were a girl and had a crush on ian thorpe in primary school you're queer now i don't make the rules go swim a lap
i think it comes from this misguided view of needing art or cultural products to be policy document -
which probably speaks to a broader social issue/feeling of loss.
a response from a place of fear.

rly enjoyed this review
snide into my DMs
Thank u for articulating what no one was brave enough to
i see the bad show #Riverdale is back.
once more to the hole i must go -
to lie down with the worms &amp;
watch this unholy vision week on week:
"shitting myself,"
"feeding the worms,"
wondering what went wrong in my life that i can't tear myself away.
caaaaan't wait!!!!
my tolerance for trash is so high and yet ---  maybe watching the anglo bullies from high school trying to hook up is too alienating or something.
yeah being a brown-ass immigrant was bad but being unable to summon the will to engage in bachelor tv culture in any way is a whole other level of otherness.
i have never felt more alone.

yay smart art writing 
Are u speaking of all post offices or of... 
i'd like to write about this in a better form than twitter someday though.
good morning.
it is me.
a 90 yr old grumps in the body of a young artist. 
the canon's full of solitary straight white men we've put on plinths.
they're falling off now which is gr8.
but is the answer to calcify marginal artists the same way?
what would celebrating collectives look like?
or more nuanced discussion around making?
"less plinth,"
more party.
"when we go to art to reify a person,"
we're saying it doesn't belong to all of us.
that we all don't have a stake in making culture.
that gatekeepers know best.
fuck that line of thinking.
this messianic view of an individual is dangerous.
and neoliberal at root -
"buying into the lie of atomised brilliance/responsibility,"
and branding.
"i am less interested in someone's individual trajectory,"
than in the ways their work opens out to others and the world.
lolllll lisa already made this joke.
it's like u are a couple or something.
so much of arts journalism is bout fetishising the bright new thing.
the trend or young artist on the rise who will solve all our problems somehow.
it just reflects broader culture:
"we aren't comfortable with people who've had messy lives,"
or with acknowledging advantage.
"good morning,"
"i have just discovered a Moray is ""a mainly nocturnal eel-like predatory fish of warm seas,"
"which typically hides in crevices with just the head protruding."""
"love to add new strong,"
independent women to my roster of role models!  
so great.
this is tearing me up 
time to move??
ahahhahahha *australian tears*
Still not over the IRONY of this misogynist alt-righter trolling us for making a fun show bout feminism &amp;

i spent the weekend making games and it was THE BEST.
i also thought a lot bout how I stopped being a gamer kid in the noughties cause every game that came out felt super violent or conceptually shallow and how gendered that actually was.
things are totally changing though.
it was so fun mark!
ah yes 'golden threads'
why are ppl on this tram staring at me is it because i am effortlessly beautiful or is it because i have something on my face and by something i mean my effortless beauty

tonight i will drink the blood of an ovulating she-wolf for strength.

looking back on my creative work over the last while -
"all i do is write about women,"
"the internet,"

wonder what the common thread is here hmmmm.
Jumpsuits are having a moment because they are basically internet feminism.
"They look empowered,"
"androgyous,"
"sassy but really they're all about pissing in a public bathroom completely naked like a sweaty wounded beast,"

i wanna move through the world with the confidence of mary
  
So happy for u!!

there is something rotten in a culture that is this vampiric about youth or even endless novelty.
"sure,"
it's probably mostly capitalism.

ty for alerting me to this
#Riverdale writers:
Should we really introduce a surprise twin twist...isn't that hacky?
One minute late:
"It'll all be fine as long as we call it a 'modern day Romulus and Remus',"
that's super high-brow. 30 secs later:
But also it all takes place at the reading of a secret will!
I honestly think all of Riverdale's problems would be solved if everyone just left #Riverdale once in a while.
Just go visit a new town.
Check it out.
I hear Providence is beautiful this time of year.
If the people of #Riverdale don't say the word Riverdale every six minutes do they just explode?

"And as #MICF approaches,"

I haven't finished the book though because I started making this salad by retrieving the lemons from my grandmother's birth place in mykonos and i left the book there when we visited but what i didn't leave behind was my three kids who really love this salad!!
end them all please and just open a tin of chickpeas and tip it down my gullet
The sourness of the lemons required for this chickpea salad reminds me of the fifth chapter of Anna Karenina which is a book my husband got me on our third anniversary which was exactly five years ago last week! -

"unrelatedly,"
i am covered in crumbs.
this would also explain why the internet has turned from cats to dogs as millennials hurtle through their twenties
sometimes i feel like becoming an adult is just about: -
accepting that the velocity of loss increases -
being super present in every encounter with a dog and that these two things are probably related

Thanks  for including our show on the don't miss list!
I can't wait to share it with you.  
Thrilled to be part of this line-up of incredibly exciting work.
I want to see everyone's shows so bad.  
yes they were months apart but also completely related in a way i can't remember now because of my great fall.
beware!
"hey i pitched something once and then i fell and developed a concussion,"
be careful.
why do we write novels when there is ice dancing.
like what more could humanity ever be trying to express.

good day!
"wedding pinterest,"
you are my straightest downfall.
i have sometimes had disdain or skepticism from gatekeepers that i have a professional degree or sometimes have to do other work for months on end to not be in living stress.
as if that reduces my seriousness as an artist.
how nice it must be to sneer at this lol.
"and there are obviously lots of factors that go into why this is so,"
"esp compared to the states,"
but definitely the cultural and monetary permission to not spend your early twenties in an office so as to not alarm ur migrant family/be broke.....is a part of it.
i was talking to a v.
"amazing american artist last nite,"
who's here for fringe with her solo show &amp;
she said 'why are there so many people in their twenties here doing solo shows?
i mean not just what can they possibly have to say but like how?
also why are they all white?'
"i should be used to it by now,"
but i am never not taken aback by the amount of people in the arts who don't have to work other jobs. $$$ is the arts diversity problem we don't talk about.
"but also srsly,"
wud these babies even be so woke if it weren't for all our tumblrs.
hmm??????
"ok my boat is here now,"
bye.
i know i am become an old because i saw a gen z tweet throwing shade at millennials and lost my fucking shit.  i shall pass quietly into the grey havens.

but mostly @TyDollaSi.
do we stop because as an adult you're supposed to be able to express yourself in your own words.
or was it the spectre of millennial irony.
or was it WE'RE HALF AWAKE IN A FAKE EMPIRE 
imagine doing that now on fb or twitter.
so naff.
u'd be laffed outta town.
i miss when we'd all just post song lyrics as our msn taglines
it's all so...aussie?
and so many cheap fancy dresses.
is there a term for uncomfortable poc nostalgia for the really really white suburbs you grew up in?
is the term just kasey chambers?
i feel like all kasey chamber's songs and music videos are taking place in the psychological and sometimes exact physical space of a Yr 10 dinner dance formal.
i am into this.

"i asked this guy i was seeing for like 9 months if he was cheating on me and he got up,"
"put on his jumper,"
and literally ran out of my house without saying a single word.
it was midnight.
i never saw or heard from him again.

this tweet brought to you by perth summer.
i thought i fell in love last year but now i realise it was just the euphoria of living through a melbourne winter without getting really sick and depressed and some guy just coincidentally happened to be around at the time.

Hope you see this.

Hope you see this.

man 280 characs is too much.
trust u to choose the most swifty moment of the show to focus on
i didn't think it was possible but Riverdale got so lugubriously trashy that it somehow looped around to feminist ass-kicking again. #Riverdale
i just cackled out loud.
I COLd.
is this show written by tumblr algorithm. #Riverdale

tldr:
everyone deserves to freefall thru life with the cheerful &amp;
aggressively unreflective idiocy of a bertie wooster.
put another way u cud also say that the greatest evil of these 'isms'
is that they kill ur authorship.
the enjoyment of an unmediated life.
there's that toni morrison quote bout the greatest evil of racism being it stealing ur time.
"i'm speaking here of discrete acts of violence,"
but course all the above applies to social systems tht ppl on the margins can be born into.
this is how trauma becomes a continuum.
u become a mirror person -
"still moving through life,"
but with some odd sense that u do not own urself.
"u may want to react a certain way,"
but instead u find ur body &amp;
mind are in conversation with a threat that u might have thought long gone.
"when u have been transgressed,"
"u lose faith in the truth of ur responses,"
in ur self without realising.
i would see in some of my work with victims of violence this ongoing abnegation.
the incredible fatigue of fear &amp;
vigilance.
"i've been thinking a lot bout this post-weinstein i guess,"
but also always.
the thing about trauma is it makes u a body in response.
u wander the world in a state of reaction.
u lose a protagonist's autonomy &amp;
ease.

tldr:
everything is profane.
i'm a grinch.
donate to services for victims of abuse.
and im not even going to start on how sacralisation around art is also a gatekeeper mechanism for diverse voices/art practices.
which is fine.
but the left can be blind to the seduction.
just coz something gives u meaning doesn't mean it can't or shudnt be discarded.
'our shared humanity''transcendent' 'otherworldly' 'connects us to something greater' -
the language of book/film reviews &amp;
spirituality.
but this is also what makes it so easy to hijack for shitty purposes.
"like,"
"i guess,"
religious institutions.
i think it's commonly read as a response to increase of secular sentiment.
so we need these special experiences.
the sacralisation of art sometimes feels to me like a big conspiracy.
we can all survive without your art.
stop assaulting women you bunch of fucknuggets.
i'm not sure why there's always a conversation about whether it's more important to be a good artist than a good human being.

he actually  achieved moksha and transcended this realm
i never heard from him again after that night.
some say he moved to Canberra.
"perhaps he was really more enlightened than the rest of us,"
perhaps he had achieved a oneness of feeling and action i could only dream of
like it was amazing to see someone so at one with their symbolic and physical selves
and all i remember thinking was 'wtf'

lotta live art discourse is bout wht the performing body already signifies.
"this sort of casting often comes from refusing 2 replicate harm in a representational way,"
"the body on stage already carries it,"
"the audience comes with it,"
it's theatre -
imagine it etc.
"not commenting on the rest of this as i haven't seen the work,"
but i feel increasingly there's interesting discourse disjuncture in how contemporary performance understands casting vs.
in lit-criticism...
So sorry Josh 
ugh such a classic reviewer response to anything that doesn't centre a minority trauma (like idk...maybe the intended audience for this work gets it and doesn't need it replicated in full to understand it as a force in the story)

shout out to the gen z bb in the front row who laughed at all my jokes then promptly turned to discuss them loudly with her friend like they were watching netflix at home.
it made the show super difficult but i kind of just wanted to give their damaged pandemic brains a hug.
Ooof

also couples from manjimup shud get money to invigorate their music scenes just as a sound artist in the inner north might -
"but  if they need more production/planning support to do so maybe,"
there should be schemes that help that along!
not ones that function by whim.
"the amount of money isn't the issue,"
its the transparency of decision making and criteria especially in contrast with other usual processes and in a keeling industry (which of course we can talk about as inadequate and restrictive in criteria too)
that's a different issue though.
"and yes,"
sucks.
this scheme is not widening access in any meaningful way if you look at it.

"don't speak to me until i've had my morning coffee,"

writer's room or support group for swampy internet women??
this is going to be a fun one to work on 
I got dosa mix at arora !!
It is good!
"oh i agree,"
hence the perhaps -
"i wanted to direct it o most ppl likely reading this in my feed/art circles have probably benefited from and sustained the system by having abundance in some form at some time,"
myself included.
"that's a great point.  it does feel we have internalised failure or a lack of sellable outcomes as negative,"
"or ""waste""."
also which artists thrive when everyone else feels stretched?
"the most secure,"
someone with abundance.
"at times,"
we've all perhaps been that person -
but few can sustain it.
but many of us feel wrong if we can't-
how can u kill this thought when the institution rewards it?
i fully understand they are trying to communicate with a hostile funding environment/a sceptical audience. &amp;
yes  art is usually good for you.
"but artists are not emergency workers, &amp;"
"it is bit gross when salaried,"
secure ppl sculpt them into that to keep their positions alive.
"i get that it's a response to an environment where art events have to justify their investment or existence,"
and like 'good for u'
"is an easy sell,"
but yeah.
not into the marketing vibe from festivals/orgs re:
artists are always resilient/
will create work no matter what/&amp;
that the arts can heal people right now.
we aren't doctors -
in pay or training.
weaponising the language of duty is really short-sighted.

there's a generation of us who grew up shitposting or ironising online -
"you know,"
being human.
we're pretty much all greens supporters.
do you want to attact the sociopaths who've been eyeing party politics and had a tightly controlled brand since they were 13.  so basic.
I'd have hoped the would have had the ethical backbone to back their own here.
"Also strategically silly to not do so,"
because 
i'm really sorry this happened.
it's deeply unfair that you have to also now deal with the work of healing from it.
"it's fucking brave of you to post this,"

 the numbers truly hurt my head.
stay safe!!
oh this is the winning one
i can see u starting this
Ughhhhhh
fuck!!!
need to sit with these learnings.
You're so right.
It's a systemic problem and I have to acknowledge that!!!
It's all a journey 
the existence of 'who let the dogs out?'
"implies that somewhere,"
someone is asking 'where did those dogs come from?'
never forget those silenced by narratives.

if your staff are quitting during a pandemic you're probably a shit boss.
ummm just a trend and repetitive pattern of really bad actions from boards and upper management in a lot of art organisations re:
terrorising and throwing staff and artists under the bus.
rooted in similar cultural causes.
 
should i lose my chill and write an expose of australian art boards or should i eat my nips.
disclaimer:
i am not on tik-tok
not sure why everyone talks about how hard it is to get a book deal?
just do what i did and become huge on tik-tok.

hahaha.  Doctor: ...
what  Me:  i'm so sorry.
i am an only child.
i'm not joking.  
i am sorry to hear this but i stand by analysis of relationships.
this is normal.
in every relationship one partner is the kakapo parrot (the beloved)
and one is the voter organising the fraud (the belover)   
most of us are trying to get to NZ anyway.  
haha right??
it's such a con developing all this nuance.
i think the most surprising thing about being an adult is how cartoonishly evil the villains of the world actually are?

if i possess a juicy butt tht attracts a baboon to my side who bites me-
"i died of baboon bite,"

maybe someday the sheer juiciness of my butt would have drowned and killed me.

unlike the vicious baboon.

i'm sorry it feels very clear that it should be me?
"not sure where the confusion is,"
"i have entered nothing and i have nothing to enter into anything,"
but it is still  wrong that i have not won a prize.
do i know what sort of prize it could be?
absolutely not.
that would require knowing what it is that i do.
should i still have one?
"yes,"
a thousand times yes.

Every brigade of zealous stans reflects a deep cultural sickness:

I hate this so much
I kno a truly just world is foolish because when I don't reply to emails it's always because I am a delicate beautiful lamb but when others don't it's because they are  made from Devil taint.
No amount of awareness of this contradiction has changed my mind.
We're all doomed.
I wrote a very silly parody once where I played Elon Musk's defence lawyer on Mars.
He had merged with a Tesla to live on eternally and was trying to get out of a parking ticket.
Everyday this seems less unlikely.
American political figures starting podcasts right now is big Nero fiddle energy.
that's all you needed to say.

I think bout this often lol.
So glad it's not just me.
I think like many terms when ur functioning in Anglo contexts ppl latch onto it as a kind of belonging/identifier before examining what it says bout their communities.

"Free-speech advocates,"

This is perfect news. @indignant_ant
im sorry but if theatre kids don't mock music theatre kids once a year and vice versa we will all turn to stage dust.
i should not have watched hamilton twice in two days.
i literally can't hear what anyone is saying in conversation anymore.
the singing is inside me and very loud and constant.
is this what it's like to be a music theatre kid i'm so sorry.
 
srsly.
Maybe it's a writing critique.
The walkleys were too loud on the subtext.
We need nuanced tweets that allow readers to uncover the structures of a brand run industry on their own terms.
Stick together to do what?
Louis CK Stan can be added to the bingo card I reckon

Yesss I can't wait 
"i'm not sure,"
but it's appropriate ur using dark mode haha.
if i'm an aging leftie and am defending anything other than my cyborg kids'
"rights to merge with a plant,"
please tell me to get fucked.
There's a real type on this website.
"Older self-identified ""lefties"""
with (for some reason always)
"free assange hashtags in their bio,"
who sound like bots and think defending cultural appropriation makes them galaxy brain.
It's so bizarre.
i'm a big fan of the word vibe too.
"it just has like an unnameable uh thing that you can't really articulate,"
a real -
normalise seeing an ouroboros as a snake who eat ass.
Wow scholars have uncovered the  original version of this meme.
Still so relevant today.  
 
....
lack of funding or monetary support is a part of what creates this unstructured space -
but it's also at some point ppl perpetuating it &amp;
not acceptable.
it's work &amp;
u shud feel safe at work.
"Thus it is like any industry,"
"but with even less accountability,"
"lax codes of conduct,"
few guidelines around complaint or resolution.the basics really.
"ppl think working in the arts is bout amazing creative energies coming together,"
but it's mostly witnessing ppl suck up to their friends with an ounce of power rather than take a stand over their unethical practices.

this was so on point.
thank you.
this is so startlingly rare i think i just teared up.
x
Fingers crossed!!
Most of the ppl speaking up now aren't doing so cause they're opportunistic internet bandits.
"It's cause we feel emboldened,"
a safety/relief in numbers.
If ur impulse is to see it as bandwagon that's part of the silence problem.
Ur fine 
I will report back 
Thank you for clarifying!
I honestly believe most apologies and think ppl want to be better.
But I am a pretty deranged and probs foolish optimist tht way.
I think ppl want to see evidence of understanding of harm plus some future actions.
I think the latter is the hardest bit.
My circle is discussing how to suck off an interdimensional being so we can get the fuck out of here.
Please advise if this is fitness or 1 night stand?
O god  .... 
I have avoided reading this to sleep this weekend aaaaa
to be clearer still -
my issue is with ppl who defend and de-centre the actual harm/
paint ppl as aggressors for complaining.
not saying white women can't be sad or remorseful -
just be aware that often it makes ppl minimise POC pain.
Think of it like a bad superpower.
yeah my problem is never with someone fucking up but in how POC are so easily painted as aggressors for bringing up issues.
And this is one sad sub facet of that -
u always hope marginality will lead to shared alliances right?
so it's worse when it doesn't.
not about Eliza -
actually haven't tuned into that lol.
"is a general and def historical trend,"
and I'm thinking of a few industry examples tbh.
anyone who knows me knows I'm not bout cancelling ppl -
I know ur learning and make mistakes -
i've just too often seen no real remorse or change as soon as these bird women seem sad.
Meanwhile POC aren't allowed to be sad or difficult.
Solidarity can be better than this please!!
I duno I read some public FB page comments lately and...yeh
once i drunk a full glass of water with my one beak.
it was the summer i was a crane.
those were the days!
"throw ur neck back,"
"quick sip,"
take flight.
the world's not wht it used to be.for one the sorceress who made me a summer-crane is dead.
nyway u don't see me goin on bout it.
not a single person in my family is able to recognise me as mildly funny.
the roles they give us are forever lol 
Ooooof
one day we will live in a world brave enough to tackle greek mythology.
Everyone's talking about these Sirens!

ancient greece.
"What's with all these men goin out to sea,"

my life is one long hide and seek with (i'm convinced)
a single uniball pen
yeah this is just everyone we've been making fun of already right &gt;.&gt;
In my short law work life I saw the huge difference having lawyers from diverse backgrounds made to clients/victims.
And how blind so much legislation is to ppl on the margins.
These changes entrench the worst of the existing system.
This.
I barely became a lawyer cause of how toxic the corporate/white culture at law school was.
I worked mainly in the community sector &amp;
have a giant HECS bill I'm nowhere near paying off.
Lucky I'm an artist now 
oh for sure!
i meant recognition of it from 'establishment'
it's also just not true on numbers alone!
"plus,"
the work encouraged by diversity grants has mostly been about mandating art that responds whiteness/didactic trauma narratives etc.

ur stuck with me like a grimy little boil that never bursts or heals yum yum.  
talked briefly to about the underlying racism of our industry.
i talk about something i usually never do:
feeling like quitting.
but i think it's a normal response to these structures to have those thoughts and we shouldn't be ashamed of them 
very rude of some of u to be both racist &amp;
sexist.

Thanks for sharing this.
truly Get Out shit.
Hard disagreeeee 
love this @_budgie
what a great idea x
Yuppp 
Yeah for me it's the others laughing along and saying equally odd stuff.
It's a picture of a culture -
what parties and rooms all over must look like.
it's coming 
whiteness will use the 'capitalism'
excuse a lot -
"efficiency,"
"industry standards,"
the way it works etc.
my saddest moments are when BIPOC internalise these and replicate them.
never!
to sign on to that platform again?...i have a life to live
We're gonna change this shit x
"I was in a room with a really prominent white theatre director who sighed and said 'theyre just not on our level,"
maybe in a few years'
never stopping to think that maybe ur level is the same boring shit and should change.
A .
Open casting call in Tasmania broke me.
Like just do a white show about white ppl -
we'll be fine it.
Don't pretend U wanted to be diverse and couldn't find the talent.
yeah why is everyone laughing 
I feel great game writing is so attuned to audience emotion and agency.
Like immersive theatre.
It's what I love about it
I think we're all at diff learning stages at diff times.
Using it as an excuse would be shit -
there's no need to excuse it -
it is what it is.
Growth is more imp -
I care more bout the future changes powerful ppl are resolved to make.
Here if u need to chat xx
i'm sure everyone's had these thoughts -
it's just it's usually at ur friend's party and u can grow in private. -
"i'm trying to call in,"
not out.
being platformed at the opera house is what makes this seem really normal.
and it's not.
because i can't stop ruining my career by saying stuff -
i honestly had full body shiver &amp;
much sadness from this.
"white comedy ppl talking bout being allies,"
if u know the ppl on this panel reach out &amp;
talk to them hey? 2016 was ages ago so i hope they've got more nuance now.
"yeah and the whole 'we can't find diverse actors in tasmania' (when other white ppl in the show weren't cast from tas),"
"or the illogic of 'they're just not around,"
but when i do find them i make them 7/11 ppl'.
it's very...confusing.

how are all the kids on tik tok so energetic i don't think a single person i knew in high school was this alive  :
no they're just american  me:
o ya i forgot  

"i know,"
it's so hard to comprehend that all the genocidal racists aren't on the same side -
it's like history is complex or something gross like that.
it took a pandemic but my email etiquette has finally changed from the gendered nice tone &amp;
exclamation points to short sentences &amp;
full stops.
and no sign-offs -
where would i be going kunt?
we all live here all the time now.
ahh im not tht suspicious of fun.
if it's doing good and ur getting dopamine go for it.
joy can animate action as much as sadness.
also would advise changing from a statue not a good week for it 
"For instance,"
ppl i've seen enforcing this attitude are usually comfy white women on the left who are excited to prove themselves allies -
I feel like most ppl who are affected by stuff desperately want 'offenders'
to apologise and change so that shit gets better.
oh yeah cancel culture has loads of value.
"speaking out and even shame are useful/important to achieve change in many cases,"
esp for ppl who haven't been heard.
the sections of the left u and I are talking bout are both not those ppl.
sure  but thts clearly not what I'm talking about?
&amp;
obvs ppl who are hurt by someone's past actions have a right to be wary of them unless it's clear  there's been change -
marginalised ppl have enough going on without those gymnastics.
But ppl who pile on for cred like they've always been blameless/
superior is yuk.
Obvs this doesn't go for powerful ppl who've been given loads of community labour and education and refuse to listen (cough Rowling cough).
ty  
"I've realised that everytime I tweet about race I lose followers which just makes me form a queef that expels itself from my body with the joyful energy,"
"and indeed shape,"
of a baby dolphin.
So I hope you all take a good look at yourselves.
same as it ever was -
"white gatekeepers,"
"a bad culture,"
no properly responsive incentives from broadcasters re:
"development/inclusion,"
few structured industry pathways for most people let alone anyone who doesn't want to spend 6 nights a week in scene that can be toxic to them.
"Yep if ur going to attach ur identity to history,"
you can't claim historical pride and exclude historical shame -
it's the same source.

Fair warning:
I have lost work cause of speaking up about this in the past/probably will again.
They love to think of us as difficult with the slightest   u gotta play that risk and that's ur choice no judgement 
Emerging BIPOC creators -
hot tip:
anytime someone says to you 'this is how the industry works'
or 'these are the rules'
"to justify ur pain,"
be wary.Treating systems as inviolable laws is the mark of someone who doesn't give a fuck about change.
Australia this is also you.
You're very happy to hire us to give cred to your brainstorms and authenticate 'diverse'
characters (gotta include them cause of funding!)
but won't give an inch otherwise.
Yeah this is common sense.
Hey if you were so concerned about the public health risk why did you basically mace people in a tunnel?

I feel like they're a Greek chorus at this point.
why all these evil rich politicians nearly always bald &amp;
white with faces that seem moulded from a vulture's skull.
enough to make u believe in phrenology.
oh ty for warning.
maybe for...a different season.

stop subtweeting meeee
Feel like white women comics think making cum jokes is emancipatory feminism when sadly it is only so when I do it.

All these rich ppl out their bathing in their rarified snake milks when they cud be helping ppl or buying me a switch or donating to causes or realising I want a switch or boosting medical research or simply sending me a parcel with my switch in it.

unfortunately I've already begun the sequel:
Lady Fartsquarth lives to fart again.
Sorry to report I have written a novel during this pandemic.
It has been optioned too.
I only sold the rights on the condition I got to play the main character:
Lady Fartsquarth.
I will be taking a method approach to the role.
Guess some of us just can't stop achieving.
it's now acceptable for millennials to join tik-tok but ur telling me this pandemic ISN'T the great leveller??? 
I polymorphed a death knight into a sloth to buy us time to escape from a hellscape prison.

Fuckboi blanches at leaving the flat but heroine rushes to help.

they reconnect &amp;
she apologises.
Grandma lives.
Pandemic lifts.
Big smooch + sex. (3/3)
Act 2:

it's time to get to know her quirky neighbours.
Including Dave -
a young man who's moved in to help his grandma avoid trips to the market.
They hang out &amp;

Dreamt last night that I became a stand-up comic.
Had a high ponytail and a casual mic manner and everything.This self isolation is going to change us in grotesque ways.
!!!! @xantheahere
Didn't mean in the reprisal sense.
Just scomo's speeches being in the ear.
Big deja vu rn.
"they were great disembarking,"
"it was just...the rest of the flight,"
especially cause there was room.
i wonder if in an airplane cause of recycled air if it makes a difference even? :/
On Jetstar this morning there was loads of room yet ppl were seated next to each other (by boking chance) -
staff didn't suggest otherwise.
This living through history thing -
I could really leave it or leave it
aaaargh.
i'm sorry.

but what 20 sec song he sing in his head I must know
 
i can't.
hah yeah I'm v.
much joking though.
I have no interest in being vindicated here.
I'm just fucking sad and scared woooo 
Amazing to think how many ppl who thought I was too extra last week now just think I'm correct and very hot.
how is this...social distancing.
Everyone's screenshots of their hangs is some real myspace top 8 energy and I feel like we've gone through too much to live through this again.
Loll
 are you listening?

I hate it so much
Yay for the city of lit office existing honestly.
It's ok.
I will find a way to haunt ur dreams xx
I want to shout-out the team at griffin including for their leadership here.
Behind the scenes their comms to programmed artists (like me)

"clear,"
financially prudent and very generous.
Really rare tbh. 
"Yeah so my boy William Shakespeare may have wrote ""king lear"""

better accessibility everywhere &amp;

omg can't believe i didn't sign this rupi kauronavirus.
this is how distressed i am!!!!1
how do i put this in a way the internet can understand:  my family didn't  come across the oceans to gasp for breath without a ventilator during coronavirus hospital overload while the young oblivious oppressors partied at a bar  -
RuPi kAuR
this is why a lot of people will find  paranoid if u try to discuss this with them.
also nobody likes being afraid.
let's be kind but also if u get it don't give up talking about it.
True!
we are not innately able to understand risk.
it was a hard lesson in law school tobe trained to look at everything that way.
artists are if anything trained the opposite -
u need to run on blind optimism.
anyway we're in a mess.
I honestly cannot deal.
"As we have seen,"
simply living to shit. 
Are you kidding me with this Hillsong conference gathering?
Thousands of people packed into an arena on the eve of a mass event ban?
ur an absolute disgrace.
Isn't the protocol to isolate while you're waiting for your results and not potentially pass it on to a bunch of school kids who could spread it in their community?
What are you doing??
I'm so sorry Sarah.
I've been following your vital work about aged care and appreciate it so much.
Wishing you strength and comfort at this time.

and to you

I hate this 
"I cannot handle another post shared about how  ""it's just the flu"""
"or ""heart disease kills more ppl"""
I actually think this is an indictment on science education (apart from the rampant ableism).
I wanna acknowledge tht I haven't cancelled ny of my shows coz venue contracts are nightmares &amp;
will bankrupt artists who cancel first.
This why it's on the ppl in charge to lead.
Workers will go to work cause of the consequences.
But I don't want to be part of the problem.
"ok beyond parody i've literally seen 3 posts in the last day along the lines of ""don't panic about the pandemic at home alone,"

Have a listen if you like!

to return to the nameless and faceless mass.
Love this new piece by  
"Extremely cool that the hindu Swastik,"
"appropriated by Nazis,"
is now being used by Hindu nationalists in a similar fashion.
It's like history is an ouroboros of horror.
This is wild and somehow also completely sensical in this the year of screech 2020.
i know nepotism in the arts gross but sometimes all i want to do is get opportunities so i can eventually give my talented overlooked friends work and we can all have a great time forever.
this weak-ass spirit  is probs why i'm being dacked by capitalism on the daily.
Lol meant searing but it works.

...the resources offered are usually tokenistic anyway.
"So what do organisations actually offer,"
is it just clout?
Does this clout only resonate with middle class people?  Loved seering honesty in this interview!
Rare and needed.

my sweetest celebrity crush (giant forehead category)

I notice she also has a big forehead.
Wonder what else they share in common?
Have to admit this coupling is oddly erotic to me.

I have a very tiny forehead.

"For the people,"

a fly has been stalking me all afternoon.
it's like that john donne poem about a fly that hovers around a horny john donne.
except with less horniness.
which is not the fly's fault really.
i'm sure it's a real babe.
i can admit i'm killing the vibe here.
'I'm trying to remember...'
sifts through individual &amp;
familial pain.
But again introspection and personal feeling are inextricable from history or any attempt to imagine a future world.
I love its vulnerability and stillness. (3/3)
Bit about the poems:
It was a joy to edit unique voice.
I love how 'Clarity'
turns the volume down on the series'
prompt of looking outwards.
Small worldly observation can be a route to comprehending belonging.
Memory makes your present self (2/3).
'I'm trying to remember...'
similarly sifts through individual &amp;
familial pain.
But this personal feeling is inextricable from history and any attempt to make sense of our future world.
I love its vulnerability and stillness. (3/3)
Hello!
You are getting not one but TWO poems from the Moment series to open the year at . 'Clarity'
by and 'I am trying to remember the moment that I lost hope'

Can we crowdfund for an island-themed boat of hawaiians to follow this captain cook ship during its circumnavigation???
can we re-enact at home
i could literally vomit at the end so it would be art and stuff.
how bout instead of ever writing a play again i just lock some people in a dark room and scroll through and explain my tweets.
HONESTLY.
sometimes i think if i quit being an artist i wouldn't find myself at 4 p.m.
on a tuesday afternoon eating a mostly raw corn cob over a bin but the two things probably aren't related hey.
it's been too long since i had a big cry.
fyre fest doc time it is.

I've been meditating for a little bit every day since the new year began and it's really taught me that 21 days is all it takes to crack and share the news of my barely emergent superiority.
me tooo
"i woke up,"
"watched this,"
and need to lie down again...

Also why not more collective approaches like other art forms...
Just finished first edits and locked down an incredible year of poets for series The Moment.

"rachel weisz for ursula,"
"emma stone for ariel,"
the film never needs to leave the ocean.

the whole ocasio-cortez team look like the actors who would play them in a political biopic except it's just them

"the only thing i'm taking from this pottermore wizard shit scandal,"
"is that no anglos,"

"a brief time,"
admittedly.
"historically,"
it's always been nazi-fied. 
remember when norse mythology was a delightful neil gaiman-ish thing and not a gateway drug to neonazi gang membership.

"me too it's grow up with anxiety dad,"

Before 2018 ends I want to confess that I once performed a sketch character who was a french octopus called Gerard Depardieuoctopus who thought all other octopuses were human pawns and passe.
There.
Now I have no more terrible secrets to take with me into the new year.

Thank you!!
Fun fact:
ever since writing this piece for I have had both strangers and friends message me every time something odd happens at the post office.

"Don't worry about HSC,"
all australian secondary school standards pale in global rankings.
or at least i do.
and i think good ppl in the arts do.
"in general,"
"be really wary of ppl in positions of decision-making who seem gleeful about hierarchies amongst creatives,"
"or over-fawny,"
or over-dismissive.
"they don't want a culture,"
they want power.
every time i send a rejection email i want to reach through the screen and hug the writer and tell them that it just wasn't the right time and they're great and i'm very fallible so don't put any stock in this and idk i hope ppl know editors/decision-makers feel like this.

ur the cutest
Ah yes.
Heading back to perth for summer to recharge as the worst version of myself for a whole new year.
all you need to know about me: -
the low immunity &amp;
persistent cough of a period drama family's untalented younger sibling. -

"long walks by the beach,"

stuffed full of mock chicken i trundle home to stuff myself into bed much like the mock chicken that was stuffed into me earlier life is a beautiful cycle and i feel very ill
&amp;
how did our health system cope when all the azns mysteriously left their jobs?
was nina ever crying at love or was she really crying from the ptsd of rebuilding medicare after the great azn exodus i.e. 'the event'?????
you may hav thought this show was about a quirky blonde doctor but really it was a masterclass in shadow storytelling.
each ep carefully heightened the horror.
what had happened to all the asians?
had their parents been mind controlled into telling them they could do whatever?
after all these years i'm still shook by the dystopic channel 10 show that was Offspring.
its nonchalant depiction of an inner-city melbourne hospital with no asians was the eeriest of spec fic takes.

So many good voices on this very fun project:   @EmergingWriters
Hey poets!
A reminder tht u have 2 weeks to get in touch.
Quick  deets: -

day 2 living on the lygon street tramline &amp;

these are not a ppl oppressed by social norms.
norms like not coughing in my face during peak hour &amp;
not coughing in my face before or after peak hour either.
blessed to be around such revolutionaries 
hey bb
both are used in civil but complainant is usually used: -
"for tribunals (so not ""court court"") -"
before trial (pre-trial)
sometimes of course it bleeds because ppl and language but...would never use plaintiff for a tribunal proceeding.
so there is that hard line.
ethical non-monotony:
"if u bore me,"
i send u an article on community gardening or sustainable fashion instead of ever talking to u again.
fuck this guy.
"awake at 5 am,"
"yelling at netflix on twitter,"
this is the most relaxed i've been in weeks.
"no i cannot ""skip the recap"""
"for Riverdale because while i may have watched every single episode of this godforsaken show,"
"including last week's,"
i still have no idea what the fuck is going on.
i need all the recap i can get because it's fucking RIVERDALE.  #RiverdaleCW
a level of no chill i can only aspire to
"very difficult question in theatre,"
when you know there will be other very different bodies in the room.
i still write to the best version of myself in the first draft &amp;
trust that we connect through our multitudes.
become the bumble u wish to see in the world
course now i work in the arts &amp;
do none of these things hahah.
here's another secret:
"all institutional spaces have the same issues,"
it just morphs.
there's no utopian place tht will value u on decent terms or where u won't feel judged by outside forces.
we make tht ourselves?
i was a pretty good lawyer though.
the 2 things are not related!
i found great satisfaction in the actual work.
it was a privilege to help ppl navigate difficult systems.
don't let this moment determine ur future potential!
ur intelligence &amp;
compassion will find expression.
seeing a lotta law school mental health stuff on my TL at the moment.
"weird to giving ""advice""to ppl a few years younger than me but here goes:"
"i was a terrible law student,"
and found law school one of the most toxic environments i've ever been in. (1/2)
anything touched by BDE appreciates
"starting a phone-sex line for inner city dudes where i just breathe ""you've really done the work!"" &amp; ""who's a big ally??""down the line till their ears turn to cum &amp;"
they pass out.

"once in a workshop,"
i wrote a scene about  pauline hanson being sucked into a hurricane that travelled the australian coast.

but mostly no one cared.

beautiful memories 
from clusterfuck to clustercuck:
these are the days of our lives
i was this person in improv/comedy spaces for ages.
but it's changing now wooo.
maybe instead of trying to move house i can just wait till the latest chunk of antarctic ice melts and the sea level rise transports me and everything i own to some cute new location good plan should only take a month.
good morning monday cry
deradicalising them of what?
this is all i can remb from yr 11 history
we're all in the gutter but some of us are looking at the tsars.  hey there's a lotta tsars here actually that's a bit weird.  wait -

if you were a girl and had a crush on ian thorpe in primary school you're queer now i don't make the rules go swim a lap
i think it comes from this misguided view of needing art or cultural products to be policy document -
which probably speaks to a broader social issue/feeling of loss.
a response from a place of fear.

rly enjoyed this review
snide into my DMs
Thank u for articulating what no one was brave enough to
i see the bad show #Riverdale is back.
once more to the hole i must go -
to lie down with the worms &amp;
watch this unholy vision week on week:
"shitting myself,"
"feeding the worms,"
wondering what went wrong in my life that i can't tear myself away.
caaaaan't wait!!!!
my tolerance for trash is so high and yet ---  maybe watching the anglo bullies from high school trying to hook up is too alienating or something.
yeah being a brown-ass immigrant was bad but being unable to summon the will to engage in bachelor tv culture in any way is a whole other level of otherness.
i have never felt more alone.
omg precious

yay smart art writing 
Are u speaking of all post offices or of... 
i'd like to write about this in a better form than twitter someday though.
good morning.
it is me.
a 90 yr old grumps in the body of a young artist. 
the canon's full of solitary straight white men we've put on plinths.
they're falling off now which is gr8.
but is the answer to calcify marginal artists the same way?
what would celebrating collectives look like?
or more nuanced discussion around making?
"less plinth,"
more party.
"when we go to art to reify a person,"
we're saying it doesn't belong to all of us.
that we all don't have a stake in making culture.
that gatekeepers know best.
fuck that line of thinking.
this messianic view of an individual is dangerous.
and neoliberal at root -
"buying into the lie of atomised brilliance/responsibility,"
and branding.
"i am less interested in someone's individual trajectory,"
than in the ways their work opens out to others and the world.
lolllll lisa already made this joke.
it's like u are a couple or something.
so much of arts journalism is bout fetishising the bright new thing.
the trend or young artist on the rise who will solve all our problems somehow.
it just reflects broader culture:
"we aren't comfortable with people who've had messy lives,"
or with acknowledging advantage.
"good morning,"
"i have just discovered a Moray is ""a mainly nocturnal eel-like predatory fish of warm seas,"
"which typically hides in crevices with just the head protruding."""
"love to add new strong,"
independent women to my roster of role models!  
so great.
this is tearing me up 
time to move??
ahahhahahha *australian tears*
Still not over the IRONY of this misogynist alt-righter trolling us for making a fun show bout feminism &amp;
how the world makes women retreat.
"Luckily sleepover gurl knew how to deal with it! ""Are you game?"""
Yeah we are!  
i...need...this
Tix moving 
"those of us from WA know that to dispel Tim Winton you must whisper ""the river,"

Asylum Seeker Au Pair Centre anyone

we should have rebranded asylum seekers as au pairs.

Please don't tell Helen Razer!!!
in sum:
emerge whenever the fuck u want.
i got time for u.
i got yr back.
there is something rotten in a culture that is this vampiric about youth or even endless novelty.
"sure,"
it's probably mostly capitalism.
but it also seems a sad sign of gatekeepers (who are older)
like not valuing or trusting their own vitality and community?
"Me,"
nytime my period's late:
Omg im pregnant noo!
An angel:
No...that wud be literally physically impossible.

The angel:

i am loving this review format.

yessss
  
"hey so before you rush to make fun of sean penn for writing a novel,"
please take a moment to remember that sean penn is a human being who has worked hard to do lots of other things that also deserve merciless ridicule.
fantasia plus
i will never forget my roots tho please don't worry.
quite a change from my usual self-image as a spoon with dried saliva stain from when the spoon was dipped into the milo container &amp;
then licked clean but never washed.
i've spent the last 8 hours editing &amp;
now can only conceptualise myself as a terrifyingly diaphanous scissors.
my boyfren is v.
communicative bout how he doesn't want me to call him boyfren.
the gr8 thing bout our relationship is tht we can voice our concerns -

I stand by this answer.

ty for alerting me to this
#Riverdale writers:
Should we really introduce a surprise twin twist...isn't that hacky?
One minute late:
"It'll all be fine as long as we call it a 'modern day Romulus and Remus',"
that's super high-brow. 30 secs later:
But also it all takes place at the reading of a secret will!
I honestly think all of Riverdale's problems would be solved if everyone just left #Riverdale once in a while.
Just go visit a new town.
Check it out.
I hear Providence is beautiful this time of year.
If the people of #Riverdale don't say the word Riverdale every six minutes do they just explode?

Me:
ah yes i see it is time for me to return to the warm embrace of corporate law
"And as #MICF approaches,"
this joke tweet becomes all too real again  
I haven't finished the book though because I started making this salad by retrieving the lemons from my grandmother's birth place in mykonos and i left the book there when we visited but what i didn't leave behind was my three kids who really love this salad!!
end them all please and just open a tin of chickpeas and tip it down my gullet
The sourness of the lemons required for this chickpea salad reminds me of the fifth chapter of Anna Karenina which is a book my husband got me on our third anniversary which was exactly five years ago last week! -

if only he could see me now!
just a cool eukaryote existing in a complex ecological web of crippling regret.
Noooo what an angel
hah thanks.
it's what it feels like!
Just heard mum say to dad: 'Don't ask me so many questions.
You ask atrociously different things.'  Such elegance in the sass.

i cannot redeem her  
is this a trick.
won't the true oaf be unable to resist eating their loaf on the way to the audition??/
"unrelatedly,"
i am covered in crumbs.
this would also explain why the internet has turned from cats to dogs as millennials hurtle through their twenties
sometimes i feel like becoming an adult is just about: -
accepting that the velocity of loss increases -
being super present in every encounter with a dog and that these two things are probably related

Thanks  for including our show on the don't miss list!
I can't wait to share it with you.  
Thrilled to be part of this line-up of incredibly exciting work.
I want to see everyone's shows so bad.  
yes they were months apart but also completely related in a way i can't remember now because of my great fall.
beware!
"hey i pitched something once and then i fell and developed a concussion,"
be careful.
why do we write novels when there is ice dancing.
like what more could humanity ever be trying to express.
cool i am up at 2 a.m.
and ready to begin my quest.
"i shall not rest till i have found the jerry and elaine shippers,"
and at least one jerry and elaine thirstblog.
good day!
"wedding pinterest,"
you are my straightest downfall.
i have sometimes had disdain or skepticism from gatekeepers that i have a professional degree or sometimes have to do other work for months on end to not be in living stress.
as if that reduces my seriousness as an artist.
how nice it must be to sneer at this lol.
"and there are obviously lots of factors that go into why this is so,"
"esp compared to the states,"
but definitely the cultural and monetary permission to not spend your early twenties in an office so as to not alarm ur migrant family/be broke.....is a part of it.
i was talking to a v.
"amazing american artist last nite,"
who's here for fringe with her solo show &amp;
she said 'why are there so many people in their twenties here doing solo shows?
i mean not just what can they possibly have to say but like how?
also why are they all white?'
"i should be used to it by now,"
but i am never not taken aback by the amount of people in the arts who don't have to work other jobs. $$$ is the arts diversity problem we don't talk about.
"but also srsly,"
wud these babies even be so woke if it weren't for all our tumblrs.
hmm??????
"ok my boat is here now,"
bye.
i know i am become an old because i saw a gen z tweet throwing shade at millennials and lost my fucking shit.  i shall pass quietly into the grey havens.

"and you know i blame and my cultural studies degree,"
but mostly @TyDollaSi.
do we stop because as an adult you're supposed to be able to express yourself in your own words.
or was it the spectre of millennial irony.
or was it WE'RE HALF AWAKE IN A FAKE EMPIRE 
imagine doing that now on fb or twitter.
so naff.
u'd be laffed outta town.
i miss when we'd all just post song lyrics as our msn taglines
it's all so...aussie?
and so many cheap fancy dresses.
is there a term for uncomfortable poc nostalgia for the really really white suburbs you grew up in?
is the term just kasey chambers?
i feel like all kasey chamber's songs and music videos are taking place in the psychological and sometimes exact physical space of a Yr 10 dinner dance formal.
i am into this.

very tickled to have a poem of mine selected (out of 2000 what the whaaaaaat ppl have a lot of suburb feelings apparently)
for the latest Cordite &amp;
to be in such amazing company.
"check it out,"
it is only the best theme ever:  
such synergy.
such KPI.

i heard he had moved to a city in another state.
i like to think that he ran there than night.
just never stopped from my front door.
"i asked this guy i was seeing for like 9 months if he was cheating on me and he got up,"
"put on his jumper,"
and literally ran out of my house without saying a single word.
it was midnight.
i never saw or heard from him again.

#Riverdale is now using the same score and editing techniques of Tamil TV serials/soap operas.

this tweet brought to you by perth summer.
i thought i fell in love last year but now i realise it was just the euphoria of living through a melbourne winter without getting really sick and depressed and some guy just coincidentally happened to be around at the time.
o no i started listening to before 9 a.m and now i can't get out of bed this year.
the tidepod is high but i'm holding on.
time and tidepod wait for no man.
i think they are literally going 'a new cave?
when we worked so hard to set you up in the old one and not die?
evaluate this or be chomped alive ya energy expending loser.'
i woke up in a new bed two days ago (cause i'm staying with a friend) &amp;
my brain decided this was impetus enough to question every decision i was making with my life.
so cute!
brains!
love their work!
so that's what i heard
Please stop asking me questions about it.
Just respect that my sexuality is Alan Alda at any (legal)

i wish this was 'conquer darkness from within...try psychotherapy'
Here is a v.good textual engagement and materialist critique of THAT STORY.  
"it says so much about the rise of identity politics in academia 80s onwards,"
"current attitudes to the discourseTM,"
and the pressures of the metoo moment.
"it's also always weird when the left starts to react to literature as a transparent and blunt object,"
like the right...
i feel like writing a thinkpiece about the reactions to it but i'll have to stop yelling 'last days of rome!'
into my pillow first
people calling cat person an article or piece are the reason i am a dog person.

sometimes i get annoyed that everything i'm writing at the moment seems to be about female characters talking to other female characters and then i catch myself being annoyed at that and i'm like :S :S :S -
that brainwashing is deeeeeeep.
"I broke down and called my parents on a Wednesday night...all my life,"
hiding my suffering from them had seemed like the logical choice.
thank you thank you  for this (and ur poetry which i love).  
i can't think of a greater omen for GOOD TIMES ahead than that song.

don't forget to kings park so you can gaze at the river from on high like a regent surveying his properly coloured kingdom.
My period's late &amp;
I've been eating a lot so thought I might be up the duff but then remembered that's biologically impossible &amp;
my hunger is just the giant emotional hole kind.
i'm just an ENFP standing in front of an INTJ asking him to shoot me in the head cause Myer-Briggs is a symptom of my entire generation's brains turning to absolute mush end it nowwwwww
i don't think so bb but mostly  because i imagine some fedora making a girl his patronus and i wanna hurl. *positive tuesdayyyyy*
Yeah tomorrow!
I'm doing something best described as ridiculous/just living.

buy so as to never forget the dumpster fire that was 2017!!!  
"when you dump a guy who is in psychoanalysis,"
it's not called a freudian slip but it should be because freud is meaningless and ur boyfriend sucks.
"like mother,"
like daughter -
it's basic geneticisms.
get u a girl with good geographics  
16 november and i think i've used up all my 2017 joie de vivre.

i'm having a lot of regret that neither I nor are behind the account when it is clearly one of the few things we were born to do.
i'm so excited.
that youtube comments compulsion to shoutout date when u viewed things.
episode 12.
what a trash heap bill.
my thoughts and prayers with the brave folk on the legislative drafting committee but also you should have just written this:   
"Kenzie Ziegler,"
I'm sorry I wasn't watching 'If I Ain't Got You'
by Alicia Keys in October 2017 like you asked!
It is November 2017 but I hope my view still means something to you.
And that you see this.
"Sangji Lee,"
I really wish I could thumbs up that I am watching Angels Cry ft.
Neyo by Mariah Carey in 2017!
Hope you see this.
"Sarcasm Ultra Legends,"
"I don't have a youtube logon but I want you to know that yes,"
I too am watching 'Sugar'
by Maroon 5 in November 2017.
Hope you see this.
wht i tell any teenage girl i meet who asks me for advice.
content is the only boyfriend you need.
  
or maybe it's cause i ate chilli and fell asleep listening to tom waits. *waits for maybelline contract to arrive*
last night i dreamt a man got angry + yelled at me because i wouldn't pay him a compliment when asked.
think my brain needs to work harder on the 'not replicating shit of the world + images of tilda swinton riding a my little pony'
function of sleep.
 
  
2017 as an axiom.
Dick is a gateway drug.
Don't do dick.
too many COLs tonight wht r u doing to me
second COL.
maybe i'm making u watch Riverdale cause i'm a good friend.
maybe all i care about is ur brand.
"maybe ur born with it,"
maybe its jellybean.
wht happened to jellybean btw?
man 280 characs is too much.
trust u to choose the most swifty moment of the show to focus on
i didn't think it was possible but Riverdale got so lugubriously trashy that it somehow looped around to feminist ass-kicking again. #Riverdale
i just cackled out loud.
I COLd.
is this show written by tumblr algorithm. #Riverdale
i don't know if u can really say i'm *watching*
"Riverdale anymore,"
so much as i'm *stabbing myself in the head with a spoon*
as Riverdale plays through the ether. #Riverdale
i was a feminist from day dot.
"growing up in a super conservative/patriarchal diaspora,"
small and big things stung with inequality.
"hated it,"
"scowled,"
wanted to overthrow.
Throw it in the bin
Why would it take so long to count?
Surely you just see which pile is bigger?
What is this shit? -
my housemate on the plebiscite
crying &amp;
fuming in a cafe reading this v.imp piece.
fellow women &amp;
woc performers pls take a minute:  
great series of writing/cultural nights kicking off at nida melbourne soon;
check it out!   @NIDACommunity
ever closer to my final form of bat wife  
tldr:
everyone deserves to freefall thru life with the cheerful &amp;
aggressively unreflective idiocy of a bertie wooster.
put another way u cud also say that the greatest evil of these 'isms'
is that they kill ur authorship.
the enjoyment of an unmediated life.
there's that toni morrison quote bout the greatest evil of racism being it stealing ur time.
"i'm speaking here of discrete acts of violence,"
but course all the above applies to social systems tht ppl on the margins can be born into.
this is how trauma becomes a continuum.
u become a mirror person -
"still moving through life,"
but with some odd sense that u do not own urself.
"u may want to react a certain way,"
but instead u find ur body &amp;
mind are in conversation with a threat that u might have thought long gone.
"when u have been transgressed,"
"u lose faith in the truth of ur responses,"
in ur self without realising.
i would see in some of my work with victims of violence this ongoing abnegation.
the incredible fatigue of fear &amp;
vigilance.
"i've been thinking a lot bout this post-weinstein i guess,"
but also always.
the thing about trauma is it makes u a body in response.
u wander the world in a state of reaction.
u lose a protagonist's autonomy &amp;
ease.

Hate tht its real x
oh fffff
anything lawyers can do now kon?

yeah that's how i roll.
i'm a liberated gal who does wht she wants.
crying is sexy right.
it's no IT crowd.
which is the only one tht can do tht.
always feel bad tht i never hav party tricks at parties.
but just remembered i can recite lengthy sanskrit prayers &amp;
make ppl uncomfortable.
is lynchian comedy of manners an acceptable response 4 'describe your practice'?  i h8 art.
ah sunday eve! -
time to don my finest gown &amp;
laugh in the mirror like a giddy heiress on the eve of a bloody revolution.
or time to chips.
the other explanation is of course to make hermione look better.
"in which case,"
she doesn't need tht help.
and also ewwwwww.
like it can't be that the producers never met a desi girl right.
cause that's the only explanation.
we wouldn't be caught in tht basic shit.
"ever so often,"
"from out of nowhere,"

tldr:
everything is profane.
i'm a grinch.
donate to services for victims of abuse.
and im not even going to start on how sacralisation around art is also a gatekeeper mechanism for diverse voices/art practices.
which is fine.
but the left can be blind to the seduction.
just coz something gives u meaning doesn't mean it can't or shudnt be discarded.
'our shared humanity''transcendent' 'otherworldly' 'connects us to something greater' -
the language of book/film reviews &amp;
spirituality.
but this is also what makes it so easy to hijack for shitty purposes.
"like,"
"i guess,"
religious institutions.
i think it's commonly read as a response to increase of secular sentiment.
so we need these special experiences.
the sacralisation of art sometimes feels to me like a big conspiracy.
we can all survive without your art.
stop assaulting women you bunch of fucknuggets.
i'm not sure why there's always a conversation about whether it's more important to be a good artist than a good human being.

Finally on twitter.
Happy 2006 everyone!
i don't want to do anything but lie in bed and read formation thinkpieces.
